        <p><b>00:00:02</b>	hey what is up New Zealand what is up YouTube I was just watching a video of Mai what appears to be Mary protesting the rainbow parade in either Oakland or Wellington I'm not sure to be honest but yes um I have so many thoughts going through my head at the moment and to be frank I'm feeling really pissed off and fed up to be honest it's it's like no matter what you do no matter what you believe in people will paint you as the villain and they will consider you to be a bad person some kind of authoritarian as if</p>

<p><b>00:00:41</b>	democracy even existed to begin with you know um yes I am currently working on an ideology I'm currently writing a book on my website it's on my website p.v I am working on an ideology known as prometheanism which values power strength and beauty you know not some kind of national white nationalist movement it's not white nationalism it's not it's not fascism in the usual sense of the word but it is inspired by fascism cuz you know I am getting sick and tired of the weakness on the left I'm getting sick and tired</p>

<p><b>00:01:20</b>	of liberalism and people who refuse to fight like pacifists socialists marxists Communists they all refuse to fight they're all they're all scared of the police they're all scared of you know the man they're all scared of CIA agents and the mad like who gives a [¬†__¬†] throw OB beast and wrinkled and fat you know it's like honest honestly you have look around like even some of the cops are obese you know it's like yes an old we live in an aging World an aging world the West is aging they're all becoming fat old and</p>

<p><b>00:01:59</b>	wrinkled and then they they have the nerve to go around calling us you know degenerates yes that's the sort of hypocrisy we're witnessing at the moment but that hypocrisy is also an opportunity it presents an opportunity for us to fight back and build our own movement our own gender inclusive answer to Fascism and of course the weakness of socialism and communism the weaknesses of socialism and communism like I said you know I'm getting sick and tired of this [¬†__¬†] I'm getting fed up with people who seem to think we're weak</p>

<p><b>00:02:46</b>	and incapable of wedging War incapable of Defending ourselves and wedging War yes people who seem to think that they mistake our kindness our wokeness for weakness they're mistaking our W wokness for weakness yes they're mistaking our wokness for weakness and it seem to think we're just we're just going to sit there like sitting ducks and take all the knocks and carry on turning the left cheek like no I'm going to build a movement that is more conservative than the conservative conservatives themselves the    </p>

<p><b>00:03:22</b>	conservatives yes I'm going to build a movement that is more conservative than conservatism itself a Promethean Movement Like I said prometheanism that values power strength and beauty and anybody can join except the zionists anybody will be able to join except the zionists and the bankers the landlords the rich yes so it's not going to be a movement of the bisi it's going to be a movement of the people who believe in strength power and Beauty not this you know fat acceptance and I don't know what what it</p>

<p><b>00:04:05</b>	is that's going on these days on the left I don't know I don't know what's I've got no idea what's going on on the left at the moment like I've been preaching you know equality and class struggle for years on Reddit and all I get is just you know people just ban me they just ban me just cuz I showed up I did my own protest on my own on the streets and they just Banned Me for no reason whatsoever it's like it's almost like they're jealous of the fact that I I'm not scared of the police or anybody else</p>

<p><b>00:04:37</b>	you know or bikers or you know whoever I'm not scared of anybody so and maybe maybe that's why they're jealous so like I said we need a gender inclusive answer to Fascism our own fascism our own brand of fascism which anybody can join except the zionists and people who believe in the state of Israel yes so the bankers the landlords like half the people in this country are not even homeowners they're renting their houses from the bankers the bank the banks are their landlords they're not homeowners like</p>

<p><b>00:05:25</b>	you know you see all these statistics that 66% of new zealanders are app are are apparently homeowners no they're not they're renting from the banks and they're paying more and mortgages and hopes that one day in 30 years time they'll have a house no you won't cuz you'll have inflation and economic collapse and that's just around the corner it's around the corner with the Trump tariffs and whatever you know so like you're not homeowners you're not a homeowner you son of a [¬†__¬†] no you're not are you're like oh I've got money</p>

<p><b>00:06:06</b>	I've got a house it's just you who is jealous and homeless and broke like no you're all renting you're all suckers for the man for the zionists you know yeah you're all sucking up to the boots that don't even pay you for their freaking [¬†__¬†] yes so anyway that's what I wanted to get of my chaste I am working on an ideology and a book as we speak on prometheanism which I created it's a movement it's a faith almost that values a philosophy that values power Beauty and strength and the love of God you know the love of Allah</p>

<p><b>00:06:57</b>	spirituality psionics spirituality power strength Beauty inspiration motivation self-improvement yes cohesiveness Unity against you know the Zionist enemy against the bankers the landlords yes so you know we need to clean our rooms first of all clean your room yeah my my room is still a mess it needs work it's still a mess my room is still a freaking mess but I am working on it I see my floors and I'm working on them clean your room and then clean your country clean your room and clean your country and then carry</p>

<p><b>00:07:46</b>	on you know marching the carry on marching the Relentless March towards success carry on with the Relentless Mar towards Victory by any means necessary and through sheer strength of will I am going to build a movement that is more conservative than the conservatives themselves more fascist than the fascists themselves but an inclusive one yes a movement that values power strength Beauty classical architecture the Revival of the youth the re reinvigoration of the youth r ization of our infrastructure getting rid of those ugly</p>

<p><b>00:08:34</b>	car parks and car dependent cities where you can't even find somewhere to park it's all Clogg full of cars it's all built for cars not people that's why you see all this obesity and decadence yes I will clean up this country all of this moral decadence in this country yes like I said I'm going to build a movement that is more conservative than the conservatives themselves an inclusive answer to Fascism and socialism in many ways the weaknesses of socialism not the strength of socialism I will build affordable</p>

<p><b>00:09:14</b>	housing Free Housing I will expand our public infrastructure our public transportation networks improve Healthcare eradicate obesity eradicate homelessness yes build beautiful cities with classical architecture romantic architecture statues Cathedrals yes mosques yes all of it a Promethean movement that values power strength and beauty as opposed to decadence obesity fat acceptance pacifism you know we're all going to go extinct it's either my way or the highway to be honest you know there's no other way</p>

<p><b>00:10:10</b>	there's no other way it's not possible to be a good person in this world anymore it's not possible you will just perish you're going to get clobbered to death somebody else will become the villain and they'll clubber you to death so either we become what we need to become or somebody else will and we get crushed and defeated and sent to to another realm who kiss her asses goodbye and then put our hopes and the afterlife like no we will claim our peace of the pie in this world and this realm in the</p>

<p><b>00:10:46</b>	material realm not in the realm of the afterlife you know like no we're not just going to sit down and take it and die no we'll fight back fight the Enemy Fight them fight them all even if the entirety of the human race is against us we'll fight the human race we'll fight the Teran Empire yes so we will fight the enemy and carry on marching the Relentless March towards Victory by any means necessary and through sheer strength of Will and I'll see you in the next one signing out princess KH</p>
