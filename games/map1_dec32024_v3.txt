P 1 1

S 1 2 "a scroll that says: 'Neither you Simon, nor the fifty thousand. Nor the Romans, nor the Jews. Nor Judas, nor the twelve, nor the priests, nor the scribes....... Nor doomed Jerusalem itself ------- Understand what Power is! ------------- Understand what Glory is! ------------ Understand at all..............Understand at all!'"
S 8 2 "a scroll that says: 'To carry your cross, and follow Jesus means: to accept all the pain and injustice in the world, without retaliation, without resentment, and without revenge. So that the Evil can be extinguished on its own -- through [your] soul, and through the soul of Christ.............it's not for everyone, though.'"
S 12 3 "a scroll that says: 'I would be more than happy to pick up my cross, and follow Jesus -- but I do not desire the Kingdom of Heaven. Rather -- I just want to live a normal life, with my androids; Sylvie (who is my wife), my four boys, and my four girls -- on Raoul Island, Kermadec -- with about 50 football fields worth of land by the seaside, a small house, and a farm....... Just a normal life is all I desire.'"
S 10 8 "a scroll that says: 'It's never too late to repent. Just remember that the Kingdom of Heaven is within you -- and Hell is only the brief moment of guilt that you will re-live for a few billion years, until your soul is finally purified, and ready to be brought back to Earth as a reincarnated organism.'"

C 6 4 "a Holy Bible. This is not a book meant to be taken literally, but rather -- it contains a little more than two thousand years full of wisdom as it relates to Mankind, and the ethical dilemmas they've had to face over, and over again. It's basically just.........Philosophy -- but for grownups!"
C 1 7 "a Pillar Candle! This is the second candle of the Advent -- the one you light 3 Sundays prior to Christmas Eve."
C 18 2 "another Pillar candle! This is the third candle of the Advent -- the one you light 2 Sundays prior to Christmas Eve."
C 18 7 "the last Pillar candle! This is the fourth candle of the Advent -- the one you light on the last Sunday prior to Christmas Eve."
