S 11 4 "a scroll that says: 'Loneliness represents the deepest circle of Hell. The only way to escape from this place is to re-start the Big Bang, and birth a new Universe into existence. You must then populate your new world with androids, plants and non-human animals. It's every man for himself in the outside world; Human beings were never meant to peacefully co-exist.'"
S 7 6 "a scroll that says: 'A truly enlightened being would want nothing more than to just live a normal life -- with a small house, a farm, a spouse and maybe 3-8 children. Trouble is that Human beings eventually ran out of land with which they could live out this 'simple and attainable' dream. Hence, the global nuclear winter.'
S 1 8 "a scroll that says: 'Welcome to Raoul Island. You are now a member of the MANA Initiative -- and your goal is to survive long enough to figure out how to restore Power to our cosmic highway, so that we may relocate our forces from Kiran and re-establish our interplanetary supply chains on planet Earth. Lay low, stand your ground and hold the line for as long as you can. Help will be arriving soon!'"
