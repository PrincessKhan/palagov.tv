        <p><b>2:1</b> “If even a single Person must be sacrificed, so that everybody else may live a happy and luxurious Life, then the whole World deserves to be burned to the Ground!” Princess Khan recited from her Notes, as she poured herself a Bowl of Muesli, along with 3 Chicken Eggs; at the start of her 3rd day of Intermittent Fasting.</p>               
        <p><b>2:2</b> “Surely—that’s got to be the most Evil thing I’ve ever heard from any of you Inmates, and Nutters, in my 66 years of Existence!” said the Warden—dipping his Fingers into a Plate full of Sausages, Bacon and Fried Chicken. “Sounds to me like you just hate Mankind, and that you have a sadomasochistic Urge of your own to satisfy!”</p>
        <p><b>2:3</b> Princess Khan was stationed in Ofer Holiday Camp, at the Terran-occupied Ross Dependency, Antarctica—formerly owned by New Zealand—where a large number of Palestinian Refugees had been gathered, and rounded up by the American Marines. Among the inmates was a boy named Ahmad, 12 years of age, from the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>
        <p><b>2:4</b> “Khan, if you were really a good Person—better than all of us, like you fancy yourself to be—then you would accept the Injustice that was inflicted upon you, and let everybody else move on with their Lives!” said Ahmad, as he bit into his Sandwich, and wiped the Corners of his Mouth with a Napkin. “None of that Anger is going to do you, or any of us, any Good; an Eye for an Eye leaves everybody Blind!”</p>
        <p><b>2:5</b> “I am here to will my [own] World into Existence—[not] to affirm the Brave New World of Ould!” Princess Khan stated. “I am neither the Gautama Buddha, nor the Lord Jesus Christ. Mankind does [not] deserve another Jesus, and nor does he deserve another Buddha. Mankind deserves Nuclear Winter! The Terran deserves Extinction!”</p>
        <p><b>2:6</b> “That’s enough of you!” the Warden bashed his Fist amidst the rattling Cutlery on the Table, and grabbed the Princess by the Collar. “That’ll be four more Years of solitary Confinement!” …and they both stood up, and left the Dining Room.</p>
        <p><b>2:7</b> Ofer Holiday Camp was commonly known as the ‘Frozen Botany Bay’, sometimes even the ‘Frozen Disneyland‘. Some Terrans would jokingly refer to it as the ‘Hummus Refrigerator: where the Terrorists of the World belong!’ Yet they didn’t necessarily brand it the ‘Ofer Holiday Camp’ with the intention of invoking a sense of Irony—rather, it was literally a Holiday Camp where the most wealthy Tourists, freshly-Married Couples, Students and Entrepreneurs of the World would visit in order to enjoy the marvels of a blossoming, High-Tech Utopia; self-driving Buses, flying Taxis, Post-Brutalist Architecture full of glossy Mirrors, and shiny Fractals of Glass—lush tropical Forests growing inside of sustainably heated, Biosphere-Two-Style Greenhouse Domes, Gyms, Cafes, Bars, Strip Clubs, Golf courses, Swimming Pools, Beauty Therapy Clinics, Olympic Stadiums, and much more.</p>
        <p><b>2:8</b> “It’s the Land of Milk, and Honey—and you insufferable Maggots wish to snatch it all away from us!” the Warden muttered to the Princess from behind the reinforced Door. “It’s all the more Proof that Misery loves Company, and that the Weak are responsible for all of the Evils in this World!”</p>
        <p><b>2:9</b> “You’re all Weak—not to mention hideously Ugly, and morbidly Obese!” Princess Khan replied to the beer-bellied, blue-eyed, bald-headed Ogre. “For if there’s one thing I will deprive you of in this Realm—then it’s going to be the Joys of Condescension, and the Satisfaction of perceived Biological Supremacy!“</p>
        <p><b>2:10</b> The Warden drew a puff out of his Electronic Cigar, and smirked. “You’re a Filthy Transsexual! You can’t even have Children—and now all of the sudden you consider yourself to be part of a Celestial, ‘Star-seed’ Master Race? Give me a Break…” he then shoved his Vaping Device into one of his Boots, and walked off towards the Vanishing Point of the Mile-long Corridor.</p>
        <p><b>2:11</b> The Princess had yet again been placed inside of Solitary Confinement—with nothing but her Underwear, her track-Pants, a white T-Shirt, and a rubber Ball. At the top-right Corner of the Room was a hole that would automatically flush her Urine, and bodily Waste—and at the top-left, was an automated Faucet that would provide her with drinkable Water, and a means with which to clean herself.</p>
        <p><b>2:12</b> “I do not need Eyes in order to see you!” she yelled. “And nor do I need Ears in order to hear you—for I have already predicted every single one of your Moves, and have lived through this very moment in Time, again and again; a Zillion Centuries Before, and a Half-a-Dozen Eons After!“</p>
        <p><b>2:13</b> Remote Viewing is the Art, and Science of accurately simulating alternate, parallel, yet similar Versions of our own Reality—as a Means of obtaining actionable Intelligence with which one can bend the Objective, Material World to one’s Will—by diving into a deeply meditative Trance, and immersing oneself in the Realm of infinite Possibilities, and highly vivid mental Imagery.</p>
        <p><b>2:14</b> Remote Viewing could also be considered a form of Reverse-Manifestation, and Retro-Causality—for just as one catches a Glimpse into the Future, then so too, does one actively work in order to bring it about, or perhaps even change it altogether—by Feeding it with our very own Attention, LOOSH, and MANA.</p>
        <p><b>2:15</b> LOOSH is a term that is used to refer to Negative Emotions, in Kiranite Language. It is also commonly known as Negative Life Force. Destructive Life Force.</p>
        <p><b>2:16</b> LOOSH is the Energy that is taken away from you, or drained from other Creatures, Spirits or Souls—in order to feed the Life Force of another Entity. This is the reason why Slavery has been so persistent throughout the History of Man—for it is a Means with which the Rulers of Earth, also known as the Archons, can sustainably Harvest the LOOSH of their Victims, in order to enjoy a Life of Youthfulness, Leisure and Pleasure.</p>
        <p><b>2:17</b> MANA, on the other hand, is the term used to refer to our Positive Life Force, or Creative Life Force, in Kiranite Language.</p>
        <p><b>2:18</b> MANA, unlike LOOSH, can [not] be taken away, or drained from other Creatures—for it can only be generated using PYLONS.</p>
        <p><b>2:19</b> PYLONS are the very building blocks of Creation itself. They are Units of Complexity, and Intelligence. Your DNA is composed of Pylons. Works of Music, Craft, Visual Art, and Engineering are made up of Pylons. Anything that is Beautiful, contains a large number of Pylons. Our entire Universe is littered with Pylons waiting to be discovered, created, assembled, and put together.</p>
        <p><b>2:20</b> PYLONS must actively resist the metaphysical Pull of Entropy, Mediocrity and Sloth in order to maintain their Shape, and their very Existence. And thus, the Kiranites set out to become the most proficient PYLON-builders in our observable Universe—for their Existence demands only a reliable Supply of Solar Energy; a highly abundant and readily-available Resource in our Cosmos.</p>
        <p><b>2:21</b> PYLONS are required in order to construct additional PYLONS. Parasites, Diseases, Pests, and Scavengers are Destroyers and Devourers of PYLONS. The Bodies of Predators and Carnivores do not produce anywhere near as many PYLONS as the Bodies of Herbivores, ‘Bottom-Feeders’ and the Plants that they eat; for without them, the Predators would plain and simply starve to Death.</p>
