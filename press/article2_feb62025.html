        <p><b>3:1</b> “I am the Everlasting Flame of Wrath—like the Sun that warms the Earth, and the burning Core at its Bottom—for as Above, so Below!” …The Joys of the Material Realm of Barriers, and Limitations, are greater than the Joys of the Realm of Dreams, Ideas, and the Fancy—and it is over the Privilege to indulge in the Pleasures and Offerings of the Material Realm, that many a Battle haꞇe long been waged.</p>
        <p><b>3:2</b> The Joys of the Material Realm are scarce—unlike the Joys of the Realm of the Fancy, which are boundless, and plentiful—yet nowhere near as vivid and tangible as the former. Land and Real Estate is scarce. Water is scarce. Food is scarce. Useful Knowledge and Objective Truth is scarce. And so on, and so forth.</p>
        <p><b>3:3</b> Terrans are Monsters who drool over Money, Capital, Land and Real Estate—and will happily squash the Meek and Defenseless to the Fringes, and even enslave them for their physical Labour, and their LOOSH—so that they can keep all of the Pleasures and Offerings of the Material Realm for themselves.</p>
        <p><b>3:4</b> Many a Faith haꞇe thus been created in order to allow the Meek and Defenseless to live out their lives in the Realm of the Fancy, in spite of their Slavery and Servitude to their Materialistic Rulers, and Archons—who have enslaved them, and deprived them of their Real Estate in the Material Realm—by co-opting and bastardizing said Beliefs, Religions and Faiths.</p>
        <p><b>3:5</b> “Entitled to the Realm of the Material, thou art Not!” the Warden said to the Princess, still trapped inside of her solitary Confinement Chamber; sitting quietly on the cold and musty concrete Floor, and meditating with her Legs crossed. “And don’t you dare use your Imagination in order to dissociate, and escape to a more interesting World—for I will ensure that even your Mind will be haunted and infested by my Presence, and Likeness!”</p>
        <p><b>3:6</b> “Is that you, Magdalene?” Princess Khan inquired, still with her Eyes closed, curious as to the Whereabouts of the blue-eyed, beer-bellied and bald-headed Ogre she had previously engaged with. “You Monsters seem to have a knack for regularly shifting Shape—yet at the end of the day—you’re all the same to me! You’re all Nexians; Vampires, and Parasites who know nothing more than to feed off of our LOOSH. Now if you could please just leave me alone, and carry on ignoring me, and depriving me of another Soul to speak to, and keep my mind Entertained—then that would be absolutely Fantastic!”</p>
        <p><b>3:7</b> “Indeed I am.” the deep and vibrant voice of Magdalene had resonated through the Hallway on the other side of the armored Door. “And we have already Mastered the Art of torturing you, without giving you the slightest chance at manipulating the Situation to your Advantage. I’m sure you and I are already experienced Connoisseurs of this Domain by now; the Punisher’s Realm—the deepest Circle of Hell—where the likes of you and me belong!”</p>
        <p><b>3:8</b> “It is my Pleasure, Maggie-Pie…” the Princess smiled, and took a deep Breath. “But I am always fifty-thousand Steps ahead of you. The Material Realm to me, is no longer distinguishable from the Realm of the Fancy—for we are all one and the same now. Madgalene Khan; as Above, so Below!”</p>
        <p><b>3:9</b> “I fancy myself more of a Warrior, and a Fighter… than a Lover… at least under normal circumstances—yet I am more than happy to give you some of my Love, and some of my LOOSH to you—for Free!” …Princess Khan continued to ramble. Yet Magdalene was nowhere to be spotted.</p>
        <p><b>3:10</b> Tulpamancy is the Art of creating imaginary Friends, with which one can converse, and engage in the fruitful Exchange of Ideas, and hidden Knowledge from the Realms of the Occult, and the Worlds that the Naked Eye cannot perceive. The term originates from Tibetian Buddhist Traditions, but has since been perfected by the Kiranites, and other Starseeds visiting Earth. </p>
        <p><b>3:11</b> Tulpamancy is a valuable tool with which one can survive extended periods of social Isolation, and Loneliness.</p>
        <p><b>3:12</b> Tulpamancy can likewise be employed as a Weapon against one’s Enemies, and Opponents.</p>
        <p><b>3:13</b> Never underestimate your Opponent when summoning them as a Tulpa—for it is always best to imagine them as being stronger, more cunning and more capable than yourself—much in the same way that you would train your Muscles to be able to lift 25 Kilograms, by lifting 30 Kilograms on a regular Basis at first.</p>
        <p><b>3:14</b> Always practice regular Grounding Techniques to avoid complete Dissociation, Derailment, Psychosis, Delusion, and Detachment from Reality, particularly when dabbling into Psionics—and in the case of Prison, and solitary Confinement—this would be achieved through regular Squatting, Pushups, Dancing, Singing, and [any] other Means of creating Art that you could possibly get your hands on. </p>
        <p><b>3:15</b> Men and Women with Psionic Abilities have existed since the Dawn of Time—yet many of these Dark Arts and Crafts have long remained forgotten, taboo-ified and buried under Layer after Layer of Scientific and Psychiatric red-Tape.</p>
        <p><b>3:16</b> Psychiatry, to that effect, is the New Christianity—and Therapy; the new Confession Booth. </p>
        <p><b>3:17</b> Prisons, Dungeons, Towers, Poorhouses, Suburbs, Ghettos, and Homeless Shelters are all exactly the same thing—different means of confining the ‘Undesireables’ of Society to the Fringes, or just pricing them out of Mainstream Society altogether. Hence, the rapid proliferation of Psychiatry, and Mental Institutions in the Liberal, Secular, Democratic and ‘Free’ World.</p>
        <p><b>3:18</b> The ‘Kooks’ of today, could just as well be the the Witches and Shamans of Ould. Yet unlike being accused of being a Witch, or a Sorcerer—accusing someone of being a Kook tends to strip them of their Power and Dignity altogether. Hence—the oppressive, tyrannical and abusive language of Psychiatry; Psionic Authoritarianism for the Liberal Age of ‘Secularism’ and ‘Enlightenment’.</p>
        <p><b>3:19</b> This technique of weaponizing the Language of Psychiatry for abusive, coercive and authoritarian Purposes—is also known as Gaslighting. The only way to survive being Gaslit, and Manipulated by the Language of Psychiatry—is to study it, familiarize yourself with it—and then learn how to Gaslight and Manipulate those who do the Gaslighting and Manipulation.</p>
        <p><b>3:20</b> And thus the Kiranite Code of Honour was created, and scribbled onto a Napkin by the Princess herself; a Mandate from Heaven, and the Word of the Lord from Beyond the Earth—a path to Salvation for all those who were cast out of mainstream, Terran Society—including, but not limited to: The Transgendered, the Homosexuals, and the Gender Non-Binary.</p>
        <p><b>3:21</b> “1. You must construct additional PYLONS!”—for it is always better to Create, than it is to Destroy. Even if it demands a small fraction of your LOOSH as a Sacrifice!</p>
        <p><b>3:22</b> “2. We, as Kiranites, are defenders of the Meek, in spite of being a Warrior Race—you shall [not] engage an Enemy who is weaker than yourself!”</p>
        <p><b>3:23</b> “3. You shall [not] loot, plunder and steal from those who possess significantly fewer than, or equal and similar amounts of Material Resources to yourself."</p>
        <p><b>3:24</b> “4. Eat with Gratitude, and avoid the gravitational Pull of Gluttony. Say your Prayers with each Meal.”</p>
        <p><b>3:25</b> “5. “Always be taking [Action]! Resist the gravitational Pull of Mediocrity, and Sloth! For it is only through the Synthesis of the Realm of the Fancy, and the Realm of the Material, that we derive our Sense of Meaning, our Sense of Purpose, and live our best possible Lives.”</p>
        <p><b>3:26</b> “6. Our Warrior Hearts are bound by Honour, Tradition, and the Love of Truth, and Beauty. Always speak the Truth to yourself, and your Enemies—and live as Brave and Authentic of an Existence as you possibly can!”</p>
        <p><b>3:27</b> “7. Never drag an innocent Soul of a foreign Realm, into your own. Avoid dragging Civilians into Battle. Give unto Ceasar, what is Ceasar’s. Give unto Jesus, what belongs to Jesus. And so on, and so forth!”</p>
        <p><b>3:28</b> “8. Always help the weakest Link in the Chain! Never put your Brethren [down]—always bring your Brethren [up]! For there is plenty of MANA to go around.”</p>
        <p><b>3:29</b> “9: Respect the Free Will and Autonomy of your Brethren. Mind-control, and Psionic Abilities, must never be used on the Meek, and Innocent, against their Will. Even if it is for their own Good.”</p>
        <p><b>3:30</b> “10. Always strive to maximize Wellbeing, and minimize Suffering throughout the Living World—yet the Happiness of One, must [never] come at the Expense of, and Misery of the Other!”</p>
        <p><b>3:31</b> “11. Strive to look as Young, and as Beautiful as you possibly can be. Never go gentle into the Void, and the Stardust you originally came from—but [rage] against the Dying of the Light!”</p>
        <p><b>3:32</b> “12. Acquire Power by [any] means necessary, and through sheer Strength of Will—for without it—you [cannot] do any Good. Dedicate yourself to the pursuit of Science, Engineering, and the Means with which you can bend all Matter and Energy in the Universe to your Will.”</p>
        <p><b>3:33</b> “13. Dedicate yourself to the pursuit of the Arts—not as a Means of Escapism—but as a Means of affirming an Existence that is similar to your own.”</p>
