        <!--<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: white; background-color: rgba(250, 125, 75, 1);"><i>...UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!</i></p>-->	
        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>The Housing Crisis is by no means a problem that is unique to New Zealand, though it is nonetheless the cause of 90% of our maladies &ndash; including, but not limited to: long working hours, rampant crime, homelessness, loneliness and subsequently: high rates of addiction and mental illness.</p>
        <p>We've seen it time and time again in places like the United Kingdom, the U.S., the E.U. and even places like Canada which were supposed to be beacons of enlightenment and liberal values.</p>
        <p>None of our leaders appear to be interested in addressing the problem of unaffordable housing, and even the mere suggestion of weak and ineffective solutions such as rent control and welfare reforms are met with derision, and thus &ndash; any political leader bold enough to run on a platform of housing affordability, is doomed to commit political suicide from the very beginning.</p>
        <p>So-called NIMBY's (<b>Not In My Back-Yarder's</b> &ndash; organizations of home owners who oppose the construction of additional housing in the neighbourhood, so as to keep prices artificially high) are not the only problem we are facing.</p> 
        <p>Rather &ndash; the entire system is broken, including our Democratic election process.</p>
        <p>The fact that people vote 'strategically' rather than choosing candidates who reflect their true ideals, and what they actually believe in, could arguably be the reason why people are collectively losing faith in liberal Democracy &ndash; and instead, choosing to support Fascists, racists and demagogues whose policies are even more cruel and intrusive to our liberties than any contemporary socialist ever will be.</p>
        <p>It is for this reason that I have declared war on the capital-owning class of this country.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Stage 1: Build a Parallel Economy</b></p>
        <p>I hereby urge you, as a citizen, to take up arms &ndash; not in the form of guns, slingshots and Molotov cocktails &ndash; but in the form of collective empowerment through the creation of new communities in your own neighbourhood, and beyond.</p>
        <p>What this means is that rather than engaging in ineffective acts of rioting and protesting, we should instead create a parallel society and economy of our own &ndash; with its own currency, tax code and unique sets of rules, laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>So instead of showing up to work, we volunteer in the community by running soup kitchens for the homeless, turning our backyards into community gardens, and running 3D-printing, programming and webdesign workshops and classes at home.</p> 
        <p>Once we've built up a sufficient number of members and supporters, we then slowly push the boundaries of what we can legally get away with &ndash; and then carry out nation-wide strikes against our employers, landlords and debt collectors.</p>
        <p>Rather than going outside and getting into fights with police (as we've already seen countless of times with the Free Palestine and Exctinction rallies) we simply stay at home and stop paying our rent, stop paying our debts, stop showing up to work, and simply carry on running our workshops and community gardens as if nothing happened.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Stage 2: Self Defense</b></p>
        <p>Once you have successfully convinced a large enough number of people to partake in the movement, and cooperate on a large scale &ndash; you will inevitably be met with resistance.</p>
        <p>It's worth keeping in mind that New Zealand law enforcement is not a monolithic entity with a singular ideology. There are about as many different cops as there are people.</p>
        <p>Some officers will be sympathetic to our cause, while others may hold Fascistic views, and could very well feel emboldened to engage in ruthless acts of evictions and tresspass notices &ndash; all in the name of restoring order, and the <i>status quo.</i></p>
        <p>I highly recommend watching the movie <a href="../videos/movies/Muru-2022-720p.mp4">Muru</a> if you want to see an example of how this could play out in practise.</p>
        <p>When dealing with police officers, your first line of defense should be to win them over to the cause, and apply the psionic techniques of mind control and social engineering that you will learn here at the MANA Initiative.</p>
        <p>Statistically speaking, you're highly unlikely to be able to manipulate a large enough number of law enforcement officers in order to advance the cause. Mind control does not work on those who have the strongest convictions, beliefs and Ego.</p>
        <p>Together, we are strong. Divided, we are weak &ndash; much like a large swarm of fish being followed by a shark.</p>
        <p>This is why it is going to be so crucial for each and every member to willingly pledge their loyalty to the cause, without harrassing and purity-testing those who may have doubts about the long-term success of the movement.</p>
        <p>Please be kind to every member, and don't force people to do things they don't want to do. Like I said &ndash; loyalty needs to be built organically, and through the proliferation of <b>reason</b>, and good arguments &ndash; NOT through fear, and intimidation!</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Stage 3: Attack</b></p>
        <p>Great! You have now won over a handful of police officers, secret service agents and even a few members of the New Zealand Defense Force to the cause.</p>
        <p>People around the country are growing food in their backyards, disregarding their rent bills, ignoring the debt collectors and building their own small businesses, farmers markets and enterprises.</p>
        <p>However &ndash; you are still very far from being in a position to take over the country, and establish a new government.</p>
        <p>Reactionaries, Gangsters, White Supremacists, and Christian Fascists will be busy building their own communes, and trying to out-compete us.</p>
        <p>Except the Fascists will actually have the backing of the corporate establishment (funded by the U.S. and foreign interests), which is the reason why the Right is so successful &ndash; because they essentially act as the pets and attack dogs of the wealthy upper class, in order to quell revolutionary sentiment, keep the peasants divided and stop them from gaining any sort of Power.</p>
        <p>Not all hope is lost, however &ndash; <b>as you still have one last weapon under your sleeve.</b></p>
        <p>For just as the bourgeoisie are keen to apply their techniques of Divide and Conquer in order to stop the peasants from rising up against the wealthy &ndash; so too, can we apply Divide and Conquer strategies to sow terror, chaos and division among the elite.</p>
        <p>And the way you do that is by simply teaming up with the Chinese Communist Party, and essentially weaponizing their influence in order to defeat and destroy the Americans and their allies.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that we don't necessarily have to <b>like</b> or even agree with the Chinese Communist Party in order for this to work.</p>
        <p>Our alliance with the Chinese will be strictly temporary, and must be established on the grounds that they will respect our sovereignty and independence as a Republic after all is said and done.</p>
        <br>
        <p>...Hope that clarifies everything.</p>
        <br>
        <p>P.s. It's certainly better than staying at home, doing nothing and feeling sorry for yourself.</p>
                <p>Good luck, have fun, make friends, and find the love of your life!</p>
