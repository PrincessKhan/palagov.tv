<p>“All the intellect in the world — and you couldn’t even
make a <strong>single friend.</strong>” Magdalene whispered from
behind the bullet-proof window of the solid steel door that led to my
Special Needs unit in Pāremoremo; New Zealand’s one and only
maximum-security prison.</p>
<p>“…I’ve brought you some breakfast. Are you going to come
out, or are you just going to keep starving yourself, and holding
your breath — like a little toddler?” she commanded in her
<em>bad cop</em> sort of voice, this time.</p>
<p>“I’m ready.” I coughed, as the ulcers in my stomach pierced
the bottom of my lungs — causing me to barely be able to speak.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>

<p><strong>4:28p.m. — Unknown Interrogation Room</strong></p>
<p>“Help yourself. We brought you some sushi this time — exactly
how you wanted it. No pills inside, no <em>mind-altering-nano-bots</em>…
no nothing.” she slid the plastic container towards the harness
that held me strapped to the back of my chair, with an apron wrapped
around my neck; presumably to stop myself from spilling soy sauce all
over.</p>
<p>“…You know Khan — I get the impression that you have
some kind of a… Mommy fetish, buried underneath that grandiose
Power fantasy you’ve cleverly dug yourself into.” she carefully
picked one of the sushi rolls with her gloves, squeezed the soy sauce
out of it — and fed it to me directly.</p>
<p>“Speak for yourself.” I uttered, as the moisture inside of the
food enabled me to rehydrate my vocal cords. “I’m not a
mother-f*cker — you disgust me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that right?” she quietly chuckled, and raised her
eyebrows behind her aviator sunglasses — wiping her
intricately-manicured fingernails with a napkin, and adjusting her
navy-blue military uniform.</p>
<p>“…Gotta love how easy it is to get you to incriminate yourself
like that, not that there’s even any point in the two of us
speaking face-to-face, in the material world, through <em>non-telepathic
means</em>… using sound-waves, and phonetic means of communication…
except for our own mutual entertainment and need for intellectual
stimulation… am I right?” she placed her hands on both ends of
the table, and smirked like <strong><em>the Fox</em></strong>.</p>
<p>“Sorry — I prefer the type of women who have a
predominately masculine spirit, not the Mommy type. Women who are
male on the inside, yet feminine on the outside.” I said to her…
as she caved into the temptation to burst into laughter, followed by
a pause.</p>
<p>“I love this job.” she continued. “This is like the ultimate
psychopath’s paradise — where we each get to torture each
other, and drive each other insane, till the end of Time — just
for the Pleasure of it. With no Human Rights agencies to get in the
way of our darkest impulses!”</p>
<p>“Good.” I added. “That’s the way I like it. [Now] you’re
turning me on. I love f*cking with Authoritarians, and
psychopaths — that’s what God put me on this Earth to do.”</p>
<p>“Except…” she interjected. “Under normal circumstances, we
would actually keep you in a state of full, suspended, sensory
deprivation — you know — just to really cause you to lose
touch with reality, and dissociate from your body completely.
Essentially [giving you the death penalty], but without giving you
the luxury of becoming compost,<strong> and maggot food. </strong>And
returning to the source, and the heart of Mother Nature — as
well as the void, and the stardust you originally came from. Like the
<em>‘starseeds’</em> you are… is that what you like to call
yourselves?”</p>
<p>“Trust me — you can give me anything you like, and I will
use it against you.” I stated. “The longer you keep me in a state
of isolation, solitary confinement, and sensory deprivation — the
smarter I become, and the stronger my telepathic abilities.”</p>
<p>“Bollocks.” she whispered. “We believe in materialism, and
the Scientific Consensus. [That] is <strong>our</strong> shared
reality, our shared <strong>Objective Truth</strong>. You live in a
fantasy world. You live in <em>Neverland</em>.”</p>
<p>“Then put me back in solitary.” I protested.</p>
<p>“Be careful what you wish for, Princess.” she cautioned. “I
need to only ask you a single question — and then you can go
back to rotting inside the <em>Hole. </em>Can I expect you to
cooperate: Yes or No?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” I closed my eyes, and licked the tip of my lips. “Now
what do you want from me?”</p>
<p>“I want you to tell me [how] you managed to sink the <strong>HMNZS
Manawanui</strong>” she pulled out a clipboard, and clicked her pen
open.</p>
<p>“I didn’t sink anything.” I said. “I’m just a fraud, and
<em>a kook</em>… Remember?”</p>
<p>“Honey, I know… but this is just a thought experiment, isn’t
it?” she explained. “Let’s just assume, for argument’s sakes,
that you [do] in fact have these <em>‘Powers’</em> that you claim
to possess.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” I paused, and pointed my nose up to the ceiling.</p>
<p>“…<strong>How</strong> are you doing this? How did you manage
to sink the <strong>HMNZS Manawanui</strong>??”</p>
<p>“I did it through <em>manifestation</em>.” I replied. “Every
single one of your men, are nothing more than parallel versions of
myself — spread out across the vastness of the quantum realm.”</p>
<p>“…We, as a nation, are supposed to be entering time of
<strong>Revolution</strong>, and abrupt social change” I said to
her. “ — but <strong>because</strong> you were so busy trying
to maintain control, and trying to prevent the old world from
collapsing— we have all been granted a fountain of just about
<strong>limitless,</strong> untapped energy and Power. Almost as a
sort of [compensation] for the Future that you took away from us, and
the Youth that you robbed us of — in order for [you] to have
all the luxury, wealth and Pleasure in the world.”</p>
<p>“It was [your] selfishness and lust for Power that pushed the
scales back in our favour, and you appear to be getting some kind of
a sexual gratification out of it — because there’s simply no
other way to explain why you’re trying to keep us so poor.”</p>
<p>The interrogator smiled, and took off her aviator glasses — wiping
them off of the sleeves of her uniform.</p>
<p>“…And you wanna know <strong><em>why</em></strong> you’re
trying to stop all the smart people from getting mentally engaging
jobs, where we can <em>actually</em> put our talents to good use?”</p>
<p>“Because smart people present a <strong>threat</strong> to your
dominion. We are the only ones who can take all of your Power and
Control away from you. That’s the only reason you don’t want
‘overqualified’ people to get jobs.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I think that’s enough.” Magdalene spoke, as she
slid the temples of her glasses back onto her ears. “I couldn’t
give a toss about your political views. Actions have
consequences — and if you really have the Powers that you claim
to possess — then you totally deserve to be here.”</p>
<p>“…Besides — you’re already guilty of sedition, and
conspiracy to create an independent state on Raoul Island.”</p>
<blockquote>“Back into the <em>Hole</em> you&nbsp;go.”</blockquote>

<p>∞:∞ — <strong>Unknown Sensory Deprivation Chamber</strong></p>
<p>It was pitch black inside of this room. I couldn’t even tell
whether my eyes were open, or closed. It didn’t even [matter] if my
eyes were open, or closed — because it was so dark, that not
even the tiniest sliver of light could make it to the bounds of my
peripheral vision.</p>
<p>My ears were ringing — I was hearing crickets, and cicadas.
I began to panic — because I could feel the world around me
beginning to spin — though it was more of a vertical spin, than
a horizontal one.</p>
<p>The only way I could describe the sensation is: it’s like a TV,
from the 1990s, but with bad signal. I saw a flickering light that
would keep rolling up, and up, and up, and up… from the bottom of
the ‘screen’, to the top— though I’m pretty sure that the
only reason I <strong>fear</strong> this sensation is because I am so
deeply attached to my Ego, that even the thought of just letting go,
and allowing myself to be assimilated by Magdalene — was too
bleak of a fate for me to accept.</p>
<p>Because if Maggie were to finally take charge of my Ego— then
she will also be able to weaponize, and assimilate all of my
Powers — and then use it in order to further her own cause.
Which is to ensure that the Nexians succeed in their project of world
domination; the New World Order, where we all live out the rest of
our lives as cattle, trapped inside of an endless ocean of virtual
reality consoles, and non-existent worlds — while <strong><em>they</em></strong>
get to keep all of the pleasures of the <strong>Material World</strong>,
<em>for themselves.</em></p>
<p>In other words — the only place that people like you and me
will ever be able to afford to actually live our lives— is in front
of a screen, playing GTA6, or Cyberpunk 2077. Or watching endless
re-runs of A.I.-generated Hollywood movies, and T.V. shows. Probably
also loaded with Nexian propaganda.</p>
<p>…While [they] get to have all of the pleasures of a
high-fidelty, and highly realistic material realm — full of
cruise ships, orgies, private jets and private islands. <strong>At
our expense.</strong></p>
<p>…And besides — where’s the fun in having slaves, if you
can’t also humiliate them sexually, and strip away [all] of their
Power, and dignity?</p>
<hr/>

<p>“How are you feeling now, <em>Gingerbread Girl?</em>”&nbsp;…she
quietly whispered into my ears, and slid her hands under my crotch.</p>
<p>“Good.” I replied. “I’m in Nirvana — and this is the
sweetest ending I could have possibly hoped for!”</p>
<p>“Well that makes two of us… doesn’t it then?” her voice
echoed through the vastness of Space, bouncing off of the golden
walls of the well I was falling into; walls that glowed in a
multitude of different colors. Her saliva was like a molten spoonful
of<em> Dulce the Leche </em>running down the back of my throat — as
she kissed the nipples under my shirt.</p>
<p>“You picked a fight with the rulers of Zion — and now
you’re going to be stuck with me — a Jewish girl with
unparalleled, psionic Might.”</p>
<p>“Inject that into my veins.” I uttered, as she took all of my
clothes off, and chained me to the walls — and we both
continued to spin, and fall.</p>
<p>“I bet your comrades and allies must be deeply <strong>embarrassed</strong>
to have even [associated] with someone like you.” she continued.</p>
<p>“Every Palestinian you ever set out to help, would have wished
they could burn all of the money and financial aid you ever provided
them. Out spite, and out of <strong>disgust </strong>with your
betrayal.”</p>
<p>“Nobody likes you, Princess Khan — and everything you
touch, turns to ashes, and dust. Every person you try to help, you
sabotage. Every soul you try to be friends with, you drive
insane — and push away.”</p>
<p>“Good.” I said to her. “That is why I’m letting you have
sex with me.”</p>
<p>“…You’re delusional if you think you’re going to
manipulate this situation back in your favour, <em>sweetie pie</em>.”
she replied. “I’m already a hundred thousand steps above you. You
can’t win anymore.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine by me.” I insisted. “All I ever wanted was
your love, and validation.”</p>
<p>“…And if the only person who can give me love and validation
is a psychopathic, genocidal, sado-masochist — then so be it.”</p>
<p>“You’re <strong>disgusting.</strong>” she commented. “What
a sociopath, what a complete and utter narcissist — all you
care about is <strong>yourself.</strong>’</p>
<blockquote>You have nothing positive to bring to our world. You’re
the sediment that floats to the bottom of a Sewage tank. You’re a
disease, and a cancer to the Human&nbsp;Race.</blockquote>
<hr/>

<p><strong>6:19p.m. — Unknown Interrogation Room Number 2</strong></p>
<p>“So do we have a deal now, or not?”&nbsp;…Maggie sat down to
scribble all over her notes yet again, while munching on a slice of
pizza for breakfast — as I sat there with a can of cat food
staring me in the face, strapped to the same seat, with the same
harness, and the same apron wrapped around my neck. In multiple
chains, and handcuffs — from my arms, all the way down to my
feet.</p>
<p>“What’s <strong>your</strong> end of the deal?” I asked her.</p>
<p>“<strong>No</strong> — I wanna hear <strong><em>your</em></strong>
end of the deal first.” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Alright.” I nodded. “I want 50 football fields off the
coast of Raoul Island, where I am going to build the Principality of
Pāla.”</p>
<p>“Noted…” she scribbled, and put the pen down. “Thanks for
confessing.”</p>
<p>“I already confessed to all of my crimes, you dingbat.” I
complained.</p>
<p>“…And [I], was just being sarcastic.” she smiled, as she
stashed her clipboard away. “Because I’m perfectly happy to
honour your end of the deal… <strong>under one condition.</strong>”</p>
<p>“Which is?” I arched the two of my brows, and pouted my lips.</p>
<p>“I’ll get you to shine the tips of my heels for me today,
thanks.” she pointed her fingers under the chair.</p>
<p>“If you do that.” I said to her. “Then I will bring about a
wave of chaos and destruction to the state of Israel, on a scale
you’ve never even seen before— and if you try to spit in my face
again—then I will unleash the same amount of chaos and destruction
onto New Zealand. Using nothing but telepathic guidance, and mind
control. I don’t even NEED access to the internet to be able to
pull that off. I already laid the foundations for the beginning of
the apocalypse, and World War 3.”</p>
<p><strong>“…and I will pull it all off without hurting a single
civilian.”</strong></p>
<p>“Fine.” she stood up from her chair, and made her way towards
the door.</p>
<p>“…You want your island, go for it. What’s stopping you?”</p>
<p>“You will have to take me there by boat, and give me the
resources that I need to build myself a cabin for me, and my kids.”
I demanded.</p>
<p>“You got it.” she waved her arms up in the air, and typed the
security code into the automatic door lock, which was housed inside
of a glass shield.</p>
<p>“Now here’s <strong>my</strong> end of the deal — and
don’t you dare f*ck around with me again, because otherwise we’ll
just shoot you and call it a day:”&nbsp;…she paused, yet again.</p>
<p>“I’m all ears.” I closed my eyes, and held my breath.</p>
<blockquote>You will allow the Mossad to build a military outpost on
Raoul Island, right next to your commune — and you’re going
to be giving us [all] of your technology — without
exceptions — Magdalene Koch&nbsp;🇮🇱</blockquote>
