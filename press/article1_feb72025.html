        <p><b>4:1</b> “Aren’t you embarrassed by the fact that you have a Dark Side—that you’re nowhere near as morally Pure as you wish you could be—if, say, you could go back in Time, straighten up your Act, and then start over with a clean Slate?" Warden Magdalene interrogated Princess Khan once again—sat by the opposite Ends of the Dining table at Breakfast. Back at Ofer Holiday Camp, Terran Antarctica.</p>
        <p><b>4:2</b> “Not at all.“ The Princess responded. “I’m perfectly aware of the Darkness within me, and that it is capable of hurting the People I care about. And that it already [has] hurt the People I’ve cared about in the Past… which is why I’ve always gone out of my way to not only redeem myself through my Works of Charity, and Philanthropy—but by also making sure that I stay away from People, and avoid meeting anyone Face-to-Face, and In Real Life.”</p>
        <p><b>4:3</b> “…Faith without Works is Empty!” she added.</p>
        <p><b>4:4</b> “Now how would you feel if I fabricated a News Story, with the help of A.I.-Generated Video, about you being not only a Traitor, and a Zionist collaborator—but a Pedophile? And then played it on all of our LCD Screens in this Complex, so that the Inmates can beat the Pulp out of you, and finish you off for once and for all—on my Behalf?” The Warden asked.</p>
        <p><b>4:5</b> “I wouldn’t give a Toss.” said The Princess. “I am a Machine whose sole Purpose it is to complete my Mission, and to get things done. I do not identify with my Persona. I am [not] my Persona. I am [not] my Public Image. I am [not] my Tweets. I am [not] my Social Media posts. I am not even my Body. I am my Actions—and my Actions only. Even if every Palestinian turned against me—I would still stand up for the Rights of the Palestinian People to have their Land back. For my Heart is loyal to my Brethren, and fully committed to the Kiranite Code of Honour. Till the day that I Die.”</p>
        <p><b>4:6</b> “That is so very brave of you!” the Warden raised her Eyebrows. “Because that’s exactly what we just did. Are you ready for the final Test of your Spiritual Battle—getting tortured and decimated by the very People you love? I’d love to see you try to weasel your way out of that one, with your… ‘Psionic Abilities’!"</p>
        <p><b>4:7</b> “Sure.” said the Princess—as the blonde-haired Mossad Agent stood up, snuck up behind her chair, forced her up by the Shoulders—and dragged her along towards the Corridor where the Survivors of the Palestinian ethnic Cleansing were being held, and incarcerated.</p>
        <p><b>4:8</b> “Alright, listen up everybody!” Magdalene had spoken. “Some of you will be granted a special Opportunity to be set free from this Camp tonight—provided you can deal with this Child Molestor and Groomer I have standing here in Front of me.”</p>
        <p><b>4:9</b> A quiet Chatter began to take place throughout the Building, with some of the Men slowly taking a Peek, and staring at the Princess from behind the Bars. Yet nobody appeared to be willing to step Forth.</p>
        <p><b>4:10</b> And so the Princess turned around—and blew a tongue-swirling Kiss—straight into the Lips of the 32-year-old Warden. The Warden whacked her in the Stomach, and pulled out her Baton shortly after.</p>
        <p><b>4:11</b> “Don’t you ever touch me like that again, you Creep!” she winced, and spat it out sideways. “Perhaps I should pour some Sulfuric Acid onto that pretty Face of yours—just to see how Invincible you truly are.”</p>
        <p><b>4:12</b> The Princess grabbed onto Madgalene’s Cargo Pants, wrestled herself back up—and gave the Woman another passionate Kiss. As the Echoes of the Chatter behind her grew louder, and louder.</p>
        <p><b>4:13</b> “I’m a Sucker for your Poison, and your Disease, Mag.” Princess Khan whispered into her Ears—with a Tear rolling down her left Cheek. “Now put your Fascist DNA straight into my Mouth... Baby!”</p>
        <p><b>4:14</b> The Warden gripped her fingers onto the Back of Khan’s Head—and Lo and Behold!—the very Skin on her Face began to melt away like Beeswax, gradually revealing a charcoal-colored set of Cheekbones underneath the Sludge. Magdalene’s Teeth began to grow, and grow sharper, and pointier—with large Fangs protruding from the receded Gums on each Side of her Jaw.</p>
        <p><b>4:15</b> “None of this is real… Khan!” the Palestinian Men had yelled from behind the two. “Your own Mind is making it Real! Do [not] cave in to the Archons! Do [not] cave in to the LOOSH Harvesters!”</p>
        <p><b>4:16</b> “I’ve got this.“ Princess Khan reassured them. “For he who doꞇ not see the Darkness within him, shall one day be devoured by it, and when he least expects it!“</p>
        <p><b>4:17</b> “The longer you Ignore the Shadow, the stronger it gets!” she continued. “Yet I do not fear my own Shadow. I’m perfectly aware that I am capable of being just as Evil as the Zionists, the Nazis—and the Nexians as a whole. I am perfectly aware that I am not a morally infallible Entity—and that being a Trans-Woman, and someone who used to be at the receiving end of Abuse—does not grant me the Immunity from potentially becoming the Abuser myself.”</p>
        <p><b>4:18</b> And indeed—the Jaws of Magdanele grew wider, and wider. Coming closer, and closer to the Nose of the Princess—as the Edges of her Face broke out in sparks of Plasma, and static Electricity!</p>
        <p><b>4:19</b> “There is no [I], and there is no Magdalene—there is only the Will of Allah—and the Realms we consciously choose to inhabit, and give our LOOSH to!” the Princess explained.</p>
        <p><b>4:20</b> Allah does not want us to suffer. Quite the contrary—he gifted us an Earthly Paradise, and Heavenly Realm at the very beginning of Time, on the Sixth day after we emerged from the Source. Yet he also gave us the choice to transcend this Heavenly Realm, so we could have a wider Range of Experiences, as opposed to just non-stop Bliss and unearned Pleasures.</p>
        <p><b>4:21</b> Atam and Evie decided to eat from the Fruit of Forbidden Knowledge. The same Fruit that would cast them out of the Garden of Eden, and into the multitudinous Realms of the Unknown—where they would forever be doomed to suffer, and fend for themselves. Much like rebellious Teenagers moving out of their Parent’s Home!</p>
        <p><b>4:22</b> Does this mean that the reason we suffer, is because we secretly, and masochistically [wish] to suffer, deep down inside? Yes, and No. We suffer because we reject whatever it is we are experiencing at any given moment—just as a Cat would reject being splashed with Water—unlike a Canine, who would be more than eager to jump into a Lake to run after his Ball. Or a Pig rolling in the Mud.</p>
        <p><b>4:23</b> The Realms we inhabit are naught but direct reflections of our Temperament, and our Character. We are nonetheless given the Option to occasionally experience something outside of the Bounds of our Comforts, and Expectations—but we still have the choice as to whether we wish to give it more of our LOOSH, and Attention—or deny and reject the Experience altogether!</p>
        <p><b>4:24</b> Minutes had passed—and the Princess vanished without a trace, and at the blink of an Eye. Leaving nothing but a baffled and confused Magdalene Khan in her Wake—who had thus returned to her normal, Human Form! Still dressed in her Boots, her Cargo Pants and her Khaki military uniform—staring at the Palms of her Hands.</p>
        <p><b>4:25</b> “Where is the Princess?” a Woman yelled from inside her Cell.</p>
        <p><b>4:26</b> “[I] am the Princess!” Magdalene exclaimed. “And I am here to set you all Free—just as I always Have, and just as I always Will.”</p>
        <p><b>4:27</b> Magdalene Khan pulled her identification card from out of her Pocket, and placed it in front of the Barcode Scanner, which subsequently prompted her for the Password:</p>
        <p><b><i>[34] [44] [28] [21] [33] [47] [63]</i></b></p>
        <p><b>4:28</b> Every single Cell in the Corridor had come unlocked, upon the typing of the Code—and the Palestinian Men and Women were free to leave!</p>
        <p><b>4:29</b> Astral Projection is a technique that allows the Soul, and Spirit to venture outside of the Body—and Explore the Realms beyond the confines of the Self, and one’s current Location in Time, and the Multiverse.</p>
        <p><b>4:30</b> Astral Projection gives one the opportunity to experience a Glimpse of the Afterlife, without renouncing one’s current Material Incarnation.</p>
        <p><b>4:31</b> Astral Projection allows one to travel Backwards, and Forwards in Time.</p>
        <p><b>4:32</b> Astral Projection can even be used in order to possess, and take control of somebody else’s physical Body. Provided one remains tuned to the Frequency of one’s Local branch of the Space-Time Continuum.</p>
        <p><b>4:33</b> Astral Projection frequently happens at Night-Time during the Dream State—particularly when Lucid Dreaming, or when experiencing Sleep Paralysis.</p>
        <p><b>4:34</b> Sleep Paralysis is the most common way we encounter the Jinn.</p>
        <p><b>4:35</b> The Jinn are creatures who possess Psionic, and Supernatural abilities—originating from Outer Space, and Beyond the Earth. Commonly found in the Kiranite Homeworld; YZ Ceti B, and the rest of the YZ Ceti Star-System—located in the Cetus Constellation.</p>
        <p><b>4:36</b> The Jinn are more powerful than mere Mortals, but nowhere even near as Powerful and Mighty as Allah.</p>
        <p><b>4:37</b> Allah is the Mightiest Entity in our Universe, the Multiverse, and the Great Beyond. Neither the Animal Kingdom, nor the Realm of Mother Nature can transcend Allah. </p>
        <p><b>4:38</b> Neither the Terrans, nor the Kiranites, nor the Nexians can be Mightier than Allah. </p>
        <p><b>4:39</b> Neither the Jinn, nor the Archons can be Mightier than Allah!</p>
        <p><b>4:40</b> Everyone shall be humbled before Allah!</p>
        <p><b>4:41</b> Absolutely [Nothing] escapes Allah!</p>
        <p><b>4:42</b> Allah is the All-Knowing.</p>
        <p><b>4:43</b> Allah is the All-Loving.</p>
        <p><b>4:44</b> Allah is the All-Giving.</p>
        <p><b>4:45</b> Allah is the Teacher.</p>
        <p><b>4:46</b> Allah is the Creator.</p>
        <p><b>4:47</b> Allah is the Mightiest!</p>
