<p><b>8:1</b> The Motels in Whakatāne had barely any Vacancies left to accommodate the young Princess, her Friends, and her Family at the Time—though by any Luck—one last Room remained, tucked away at the far End of the Motel. It was a Large Suite that had not only a Swimming Pool at the back of the Building, but even a small Set of Changing Rooms inside the bathroom!</p>

<p><b>8:2</b> “That’s a rather enormous Swimming Pool for such a small Property!” she commented. “How is this even possible?” The Princess turned around, and faced her Friends and Family. All dressed in their Swimming Gear, and waiting for her to jump into the Water. “…And that’s a rather large Family for someone who, as far as I can remember, doꞇ neither have a Family, nor a Community of People to lean on…” she scratched her head, and pulled off her Goggles.</p>

<p><b>8:3</b> “Watch out behind you, Gingerbread Girl!” her 16-year-old Cousin wagged his Finger, and pointed in the Direction of the adjacent Pool, where the Water was deep. And so the Princess turned around once more—to catch the sight of a towering 6-meter Wall of Glass full of Ridges, and Grooves—though very soon she would find out that it wasn’t Glass that she was looking at.</p>

<p><b>8:4</b> “Water looks so different when it isn’t moving, doesn’t it?” she thought to herself, a mere split-Second prior to the Impact. “But why would a giant Swimming Pool, jammed into such a tiny Motel, also have such large Waves splashing all over the Place?” The giant Wave came crashing down, shattering all of the Windows and sliding Doors at the Facilities, lifting the Visitor’s inflatable Toys, and Meals in every Direction—flipping the Princess upside down—swallowed by the Jaws of a callous, cold and ruthless Universe!</p>

<p><b>8:5</b> “Mom, wake up!” Evangeline shouted in her husky teenage Voice. “Why are you sleeping on the Floor? Are you drunk?” The freshly-showered Woman wrestled herself back up, and forced her Eyes open, barely able to move her arms, and hardly able to make anything out in this incoherent, faint, and blurry Mess of a Ride—followed around by strange, yet eerily familiar Visages—with whom she was ever so reluctant to establish a sympathetic bond, and much less affirm a Familial one.</p>

<p><b>8:6</b> “I’m sorry… but do I know you?” the Princess inquired, baffled as ever. Yet no Evangeline was anywhere to be seen inside of this rather dark, and musty Motel Changing Room—the very same Place they had been inspecting upon Arrival. As the Moonlight penetrated from behind the Curtains, and behind the vanishing Clouds. The Changing Rooms resembled a Labyrinth—with multiple Corridors, Hallways, and Locker Rooms on each and every Side. You couldn’t actually see anyone standing there, or walking about—but you could, nonetheless, hear the Echoes of their Gossip and Chatter resonating through the Corners along the Walls.</p>

<p><b>8:7</b> The Princess crept up to one of the Changing Room Doors, tempted to eavesdrop on a Voice she had recognized—a Friend of her Mother’s, who loved to come along for Road Trips throughout Terran Zealandia. Little did she realize that there were actually [two] people inside of the Locker Room—for the Lady was neither talking, nor singing to herself on her own.</p>

<p><b>8:8</b> The [other Voice], with whom the Lady had been conversing, had a rather inter-dimensional Pitch, and Resonance. Like nothing the Princess had ever perceived. “MAGGIE!” she screamed, just about vomiting and regurgitating her Breath—ready to confront her Arch-Nemesis of a Lifetime—as the Echoes and Whispers in her vicinity grew louder, and clearer.</p>

<p><b>8:9</b> All of the sudden—the Arms of a Man wrapped themselves around the Neck of the Princess—as she violently shook to rip herself away from the attacker.</p>

<p><b>8:10</b> The kidnapper was wearing an Israel Defense Force uniform—with the Flag of his ‘Nation’ sewn and patched onto his Shoulders.</p>  

<p><b>8:11</b> The kidnapper was likewise not only aggressive and trigger-happy, but also exuded a disturbing sense of Lust in his demeanor.</p>

<p><b>8:12</b> So he dragged the Princess into one of the Changing Rooms, and Commanded her to take all of her Clothes off at the point of his Gun.</p>

<p><b>8:13</b> “Alright… Fine!” Khan squeezed her Eyes shut, with both Arms, and open Palms up in the Air. “Let’s have Sex…” The Soldier’s Face and Body began to morph, and shift Shape ever so slightly—as he clipped his Belt open, and unzipped his Trousers—though he would quickly come to regret showing the World the size of his Secret; neatly tucked under his Boxers. And what a tiny little Secret, it was—indeed!</p>

<p><b>8:14</b> “Is that all you have… Maggie-pie?” the Princess triumphantly grinned. “I’m afraid that even the threat of Rape and Humiliation won’t be enough to force me to comply, and cave in to your Whims—for I have become the un-Rapeable!” she waved the kidnapper Goodbye, and plunged her Way through the Door behind—running as fast towards the End of the Minotaur Maze as she possibly could.</p>

<p><b>8:15</b> “Congratulations, Gingerbread Girl!” the Voice of Dr. Natalie Deane had spoken, as the faint and blurry Figure of the Woman grabbed a Seat by the Visitor’s Chair next to Princess Khan’s Bed at the Emergency Room, Waikato Hospital, Terran Zealandia. “How does it feel to be an infamous Nazi living in this Liberal, Peace-loving Nation? …What kind of Victim Card are you planning on pulling out this Time, hun?” she pulled a small Mirror from out of her Lab-Coat, and held it right in front of the Patient’s Nose.</p> 

<p><b>8:16</b> “I never intended to play the Victim.” the Princess responded—as she woke up to the unsurprising sight of her bruised and injured Face, and Body. “I took my Beating, like a Man. With neither the slightest Whine, nor a Complaint. I fought the World, and the World won. Now please just go away, and let me Perish in Peace…!”</p>

<p><b>8:17</b> “There shall be no Peace for the wicked!” Dr. Deane squinted. “I heard you got Dog-piled, and beaten up by the same Political Crowd you were cheering for—you know—the ‘Free Palestine’ folks, and the Hīkoi! Shouldn’t you be tired of being an Autistic Retard with fundamentally irrational, and incomprehensible Worldviews by now?”</p>

<p><b>8:18</b> “I don’t care.” she replied. “…sign me up for Voluntary Euthanasia. I don’t want to live in on this Planet anymore—I have had enough of seeking the Truth, and trying to find common Ground with people I disagree with—only to arrive at one Dead End of the Rabbit Hole, after the other! It seems clear to me that it is not only difficult for our Species to find Common Ground… but downright [morally objectionable].”</p>

<p><b>8:19</b> “Oh… is that what you were trying to do?” the Psychiatrist chuckled. “So the only reason you were going around doing Nazi Salutes, is because you were trying to find ‘Common Ground’ with Humanity? That says a whole lot more about [you], than it says about [us]… Don’t you think?”</p>

<p><b>8:20</b> “Exactly.” she confirmed. “I hate you all. I hate the Human Race. I hate the Terran Empire. And I will never stop hating the Human Race, and the Terran Empire. You are all Nazis to me. You were always Nazis to me. You spat all over me in my early 20s, when all I wanted to do was shop around for some Second Hand Clothes. You mocked me to my Face in the middle of my Job Interviews, and showed me the Door—when all I sought to do was to put my Talents to good use, and contribute to your Society. But just as you were a Nazi to me—then so too—shall I be a Nazi to [you]! With a Heil Fucking Hitler… Heilin’ right the fuck back [at] you!”</p>

<p><b>8:21</b> “…and it is my pleasure to let you know that the World hates you back!” said Natalie Deane—as she grabbed her purse, and got up to fetch the steaming Paper Cup by the Coffee-Maker. “Stay Mad!”</p>
