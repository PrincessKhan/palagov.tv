	<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: green; background-color: rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.25);"><i>Last modified: 17th of November, 2024 at 3:32p.m.</i></p>
<p><b>A Quick Preface</b></p>
<p>What I'm about to cover are not necessarily the specifics of Enlightenment, but the overall gist of it &ndash; much like how one could draw a map of a city, without having to outline every single bench, tree and parking spot.</p>
<p>We had it all wrong‚Äîlike, all of it. However, I do believe that the ideas of the Buddha are among the closest representations of the Truth, though it's fair to say that many of these ideas have been 'bastardized' by the simple-minded, consumerist, New Age Westerners who hve sought to adopt them in recent years (he never actually wrote anything down, if I remember correctly).</p>
<p>Another topic of interest to me has been Islam, particularly as it relates to the creation and maintenance of societies and civilizations. Buddhism in my opinion is a little too solipsistic in its approach to the nature of Reality, and how we relate to other people, which probably explains why it has gained the popularity that it has in our hyper-individualistic, yet spiritually-hungry modern age; where it was only a matter of time until the void left behind by the fall of Christianity would end up being filled by something equally mystical.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center;">...</p>
<p><b>Why Haven't We Built<br>A Perfect World Yet?</b></p>
<p>You‚Äôve probably heard the phrase: "One man‚Äôs Heaven is another man‚Äôs Hell." ..and it's incredibly frustrating to live in a world where no one can agree on how to solve our problems‚Äînot even the most obvious, 'no-brainer' issues like housing and food security.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the thing: Most people don‚Äôt realize that you can already be living in the world you desire, as long as you are honest with yourself and 'prematurely grateful' to be living in such a world without taking it for granted, and as long as you are actively working towards manifesting or 'imposing' such a world onto the material reality around you, assuming there even is such a thing.</p>

<p>The reason Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden wasn‚Äôt because they were punished, but because they had outgrown it and wanted to explore another reality of their own choosing. It‚Äôs like a teenager moving out of their parents‚Äô house to get their own place‚Äîtaking on responsibilities and dealing with the challenges of adult life, without necessarily resenting them.</p>

<p>Sure, you could say they were greedy and ungrateful, but that‚Äôs just one perspective. It‚Äôs not as if God enjoyed kicking them out of their childhood home. The apple was more like an emergency escape button, like taking the red pill in the 1999 movie <i>'Matrix'</i>. They could either stay in the Garden of Eden with endless pleasure, or be reincarnated into another world where they can grow as individuals.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center;">...</p>

<p>I‚Äôve thus mapped out seven different realms that individuals not only explore in the 'afterlife', but also in the [current life] (it's the same thing - for there is endless continuity between your journeys through the lives of a multitude of Humans, and non-Human creatures alike!)</p>
<br>

<p><b>The Warriors' Realm</b></p>
<p>This is where soldiers, generals, MMA fighters, and those who love the rush of battle go.</p>
<p>They thrive on the honor, masculinity, and significance that comes from conflict, and they seek out battle after battle‚Äîeven in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Without conflict, they‚Äôd go insane. Many women or non-binary people with masculine spirits may also end up here.</p>
<p>This world would feel like Hell to those who prefer peace and stability‚Äîthe meek, the innocent, and those who just want to live without conflict.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the world we currently inhabit‚Äîwedged between the Warrior‚Äôs Realm, the Merchants' Realm, and the Pleasure Realm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Pleasure Realm</b></p>
<p>This is where food connoisseurs, heavy cannabis users, shopaholics, gamblers, drinkers, sex addicts, and party-goers go.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a world of indulgence‚Äîendless orgies, buffets, and bong-ripping sessions.</p>
<p>Many artists who struggled with addiction‚Äîlike Mozart, Robin Williams, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley‚Äîmay end up here.</p>
<p>Pets like cats, dogs, and hamsters also live here, as they lead a more carefree existence. It‚Äôs a life of minimal struggle, where pleasure is the goal.</p>
<p>Somebody who feels genuine contempt (but not envy) toward those who indulge in endless pleasure would find such a world to be decadent, ugly, and meaningless‚Äîand would be expelled from this realm pretty quickly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Punisher's Realm</b></p>
<p>This is the most disturbing realm of all‚Äîliterally a realm of torture, disease, boredom, sadness, and endless cruelty.</p>
<p>Those who end up here actively seek out pain and suffering‚Äîlike masochists and the most depraved murderers and psychopaths.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a mistake to think they‚Äôre being punished because they genuinely enjoy it.</p>
<p>The true punishment is reserved for those who thought they were hardened monsters, but eventually regretted their choices.</p>
<p>Their self-loathing and regret is the actual punishment, not necessarily the external punishment.</p>
<p>Someone like Charles Manson resides here (happily so).</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Jungle Realm</b></p>
<p>This is where animals end up‚Äîanimals who get eaten by other animals, as well as many humans.</p>
<p>Think of people who live alone in a cabin in the woods. Those who despise technology and (industrial) civilization.</p>
<p>Those who genuinely despise law and order.</p>
<p>Uncontacted Amazon tribes live here as well, and animals like ants, cockroaches, and snakes live in this realm.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a place without laws, rules, or regulations‚Äîcompletely free.</p>
<p>This realm would be hell for someone who prefers civilization, and the comfort and security that it brings.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Merchant's Realm</b></p>
<p>This is where entrepreneurs, workaholics, poker players, salesmen, real estate agents, bankers, CEOs, pyramid schemers, and many kings and queens eventually go.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not necessarily a realm of pleasure, but a realm of endless trade and commerce.</p>
<p>Everything is a market here‚Äîeven love and friendship. Everything comes with a price tag, because everything is for sale.</p>
<p>Everything here is an endless battle to be the wealthiest and richest of all‚Äîmuch like the Warrior‚Äôs Realm, minus the actual fighting.</p>
<p>Everyone here has a poker face, and nobody really trusts the other‚Äîbut everyone is willing to show what they bring to the table, and what they have to offer.</p>
<p>Endless transactions, endless poker games, endless stacks of money, etc.</p>
<p>Al Capone, Howard Hughes, Hugh Hefner, and the Wolf of Wall Street reside here.</p>
<p>Somebody who is genuinely content with the bare minimum would find such a realm to be Hell. Those who value experiences more than they value material possessions.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Lover's Realm</b></p>
<p>Similar to the Pleasure Realm, but not as decadent and indulgent.</p>
<p>This is arguably the highest form of heaven, though again‚Äîit depends on which type of spirit you are.</p>
<p>This is where the most passionate, romantic, and platonic lovers go (not necessarily the most sexually active, because that belongs to the Pleasure Realm).</p>
<p>This is where Jesus and Gandhi probably reside. Endless, boundless love‚Äîunconditional love, with no strings attached.</p>
<p>Many artists also end up here, those who genuinely LOVE to create.</p>
<p>This is where Romeo & Juliet, Casanova, and even people like Bonnie and Clyde reside (even though they'll generally also be wedged between other realms, such as the Merchant's Realm and the Pleasure Realm).</p>
<p>Somebody who despises attachments, compliments, and 'getting too close to anybody for fear of being hurt' might find such a realm to be Hell.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Nothing Realm</b></p>
<p>This realm is truly the Void‚Äîan endless ocean of peace and quiet, where nothing exciting happens, but also nothing dangerous or violent.</p>
<p>No pain, no pleasure‚Äîjust endless silence and tranquility for all eternity.</p>
<p>No more birth, no more death‚Äîa truly anti-natalist realm.</p>
<p>Somebody who genuinely wants to be alive would find such a realm to be Hell.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm pretty sure the Buddha may be here, though I don't really know the Buddha as a person, so I will refrain from making any assumptions.</p>
