	<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: green; background-color: rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.25);"><i>Last modified: 4th of October, 2024 at 8:14p.m.</i></p>
<p><b>A Quick Preface</b></p>
<p>I can pretty confidently say that I’ve cracked the essence of Enlightenment at this point &ndash; though it's not something that your average 'Truth-seeker' will necessarily find pleasant, much less a Reddit moderator.</p> 
<p>...Presumably due to the fact that their whole website is in a state of Khan Equilibrium, where discussion cannot really take place, because everyone already knows what everybody else has to say, <i>telepathically.</i></p> 
<p>And since they've already heard it all before - there's really no use in talking about anything new, right?</p> 

<p>What I'm about to cover are not necessarily the specifics of Enlightenment, but the overall gist of it &ndash; much like how one could draw a map of a city, without having to outline every single bench, tree and parking spot.</p>

<p>We had it all wrong—like, all of it. However, I do believe that the Buddha came closest to the truth, even if he didn’t properly articulate it (he never actually wrote anything down, if I remember correctly).</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center;">...</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard the phrase: "One man’s Heaven is another man’s Hell." ..and it's incredibly frustrating to live in a world where no one can agree on how to solve our problems—not even the most obvious, 'no-brainer' issues like housing and food security.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: Most people don’t realize that you can already be living in the world you desire, as long as you are honest with yourself and genuinely grateful to live in such a world without taking it for granted.</p>

<p>The reason Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden wasn’t because they were punished, but because they had outgrown it and wanted to explore another reality of their own choosing. It’s like a teenager moving out of their parents’ house to get their own place—taking on responsibilities and dealing with the challenges of adult life, without necessarily resenting them.</p>

<p>Sure, you could say they were greedy and ungrateful, but that’s just one perspective. It’s not that God enjoyed kicking them out. The apple was more like an emergency escape button, like taking the red pill in The Matrix. They could either stay in the Garden of Eden with endless pleasure, or be reincarnated into another world where they can grow as individuals.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center;">...</p>

<p>I’ve thus mapped out seven different realms that individuals not only explore in the 'afterlife', but also in the [current life] (it's the same thing - there is endless continuity!)</p>
<br>

<p><b>The Warriors' Realm</b></p>
<p>This is where soldiers, generals, MMA fighters, and those who love the rush of battle go.</p>
<p>They thrive on the honor, masculinity, and significance that comes from conflict, and they seek out battle after battle—even in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Without conflict, they’d go insane. Many women or non-binary people with masculine spirits may also end up here.</p>
<p>This world would feel like Hell to those who prefer peace and stability—the meek, the innocent, and those who just want to live without conflict.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the world we currently inhabit—wedged between the Warrior’s Realm, the Merchants' Realm, and the Pleasure Realm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Pleasure Realm</b></p>
<p>This is where food connoisseurs, heavy cannabis users, shopaholics, gamblers, drinkers, sex addicts, and party-goers go.</p>
<p>It’s a world of indulgence—endless orgies, buffets, and bong-ripping sessions.</p>
<p>Many artists who struggled with addiction—like Mozart, Robin Williams, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley—may end up here.</p>
<p>Pets like cats, dogs, and hamsters also live here, as they lead a more carefree existence. It’s a life of minimal struggle, where pleasure is the goal.</p>
<p>Somebody who feels genuine contempt (but not envy) toward those who indulge in endless pleasure would find such a world to be decadent, ugly, and meaningless—and would be expelled from this realm pretty quickly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Punisher's Realm</b></p>
<p>This is the most disturbing realm of all—literally a realm of torture, disease, boredom, sadness, and endless cruelty.</p>
<p>Those who end up here actively seek out pain and suffering—like masochists and the most depraved murderers and psychopaths.</p>
<p>It’s a mistake to think they’re being punished because they genuinely enjoy it.</p>
<p>The true punishment is reserved for those who thought they were hardened monsters, but eventually regretted their choices.</p>
<p>Their self-loathing and regret is the actual punishment, not necessarily the external punishment.</p>
<p>Someone like Charles Manson resides here (happily so).</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Jungle Realm</b></p>
<p>This is where animals end up—animals who get eaten by other animals, as well as many humans.</p>
<p>Think of people who live alone in a cabin in the woods. Those who despise technology and (industrial) civilization.</p>
<p>Those who genuinely despise law and order.</p>
<p>Uncontacted Amazon tribes live here as well, and animals like ants, cockroaches, and snakes live in this realm.</p>
<p>It’s a place without laws, rules, or regulations—completely free.</p>
<p>This realm would be hell for someone who prefers civilization, and the comfort and security that it brings.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Merchant's Realm</b></p>
<p>This is where entrepreneurs, workaholics, poker players, salesmen, real estate agents, bankers, CEOs, pyramid schemers, and many kings and queens eventually go.</p>
<p>It’s not necessarily a realm of pleasure, but a realm of endless trade and commerce.</p>
<p>Everything is a market here—even love and friendship. Everything comes with a price tag, because everything is for sale.</p>
<p>Everything here is an endless battle to be the wealthiest and richest of all—much like the Warrior’s Realm, minus the actual fighting.</p>
<p>Everyone here has a poker face, and nobody really trusts the other—but everyone is willing to show what they bring to the table, and what they have to offer.</p>
<p>Endless transactions, endless poker games, endless stacks of money, etc.</p>
<p>Al Capone, Howard Hughes, Hugh Hefner, and the Wolf of Wall Street reside here.</p>
<p>Somebody who is genuinely content with the bare minimum would find such a realm to be Hell. Those who value experiences more than they value material possessions.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Lover's Realm</b></p>
<p>Similar to the Pleasure Realm, but not as decadent and indulgent.</p>
<p>This is arguably the highest form of heaven, though again—it depends on which type of spirit you are.</p>
<p>This is where the most passionate, romantic, and platonic lovers go (not necessarily the most sexually active, because that belongs to the Pleasure Realm).</p>
<p>This is where Jesus and Gandhi probably reside. Endless, boundless love—unconditional love, with no strings attached.</p>
<p>Many artists also end up here, those who genuinely LOVE to create.</p>
<p>This is where Romeo & Juliet, Casanova, and even people like Bonnie and Clyde reside (even though they'll generally also be wedged between other realms, such as the Merchant's Realm and the Pleasure Realm).</p>
<p>Somebody who despises attachments, compliments, and 'getting too close to anybody for fear of being hurt' might find such a realm to be Hell.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Nothing Realm</b></p>
<p>This realm is truly the Void—an endless ocean of peace and quiet, where nothing exciting happens, but also nothing dangerous or violent.</p>
<p>No pain, no pleasure—just endless silence and tranquility for all eternity.</p>
<p>No more birth, no more death—a truly anti-natalist realm.</p>
<p>Somebody who genuinely wants to be alive would find such a realm to be Hell.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the Buddha may be here, though I don't really know the Buddha as a person, so I will refrain from making any assumptions.</p>
