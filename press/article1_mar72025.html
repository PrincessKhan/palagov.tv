<p><b>10:1</b> "Mom!" Alzira’s Voice had rung out from behind the closed Door of her small Bedroom, screeching like a Cricket. "Mom, can you come? It’s The Rooster again!" Sahliya Din jolted awake, sending Ripples through the queen-sized Mattress. Her Partner lay wide awake beside her, tossing and turning, unable to get her four Hours worth of a Snooze, even.</p>
<p><b>10:2</b> With a sigh of Reluctance—she rolled her Blanket up, put her Slippers on, and then slowly made her way towards Alzira’s Room—being careful not to disturb everybody else in the House. “…What’s the matter, Love?” she whispered, pressing her Cheeks close to the narrow Gap between the Door and the Frame. “Another Nightmare?”</p>
<p><b>10:3</b> "Mom, be careful!" Alzira’s Voice trembled. "There’s broken Glass on the Floor." Sahliya nudged the Door open just a little wider—and felt the Weight of the Shards of a broken Mirror scattered across the cold, hard Floor—their jagged Edges catching the dim Glow of the Hallway Light.</p>
<p><b>10:4</b> The Mother’s Voice tightened. “Alzira… what happened here? Who did this?” Her 3-Year-old Daughter sniffled, swallowing back her Sobs. “I—I don’t know…” she stammered, coughing up Mucus and Tears. “The Rooster came in through the Window… and then—then it went inside my Stomach!”</p>
<p><b>10:5</b> Sahliya crouched down to scan the Mess, exhaling slowly as she reached for the Brush and Shovel in the Cupboard. "Sweetheart, we’re all here. Nothing can hurt you. But can we talk about this in the Morning? You need your Sleep to grow strong, smart, and healthy—just like your Mom!”</p>
<p><b>10:6</b> “No! You don’t understand!" Alzira’s Breath hitched. "The Rooster went inside me—inside my Stomach! And then it went into the Mirror, and the Mirror shattered!"</p>
<p><b>10:7</b> From the other End of the Hallway, her second Parent—Princess Klea, approached the Scene—stepping into the dimly lit Room. She knelt beside Sahliya, quietly helping her sweep the Shards into a neat Pile. Her Gaze lingered on the broken Mirror, reflecting naught but a disjointed Set of Eyes. Then, after a long Pause, she spoke: "…I've actually had the exact same Dream as you when I was [your] Age, Alzira."</p>
<p><b>10:8</b> The little Girl’s Tear-filled Eyes darted up at them, wide and frightened. "History is repeating itself," the Princess murmured. "It’s happening all over again. The Archons have arrived in search of their generational Dose of LOOSH."</p>
<p><b>10:9</b> The Sun was just about to rise over the Hills of Gaza—reflecting off of the golden, amber-colored Walls of the half-a-Dozen-Story Buildings in the Neighborhood—as Klea’s Family rushed to the Kitchen to Cook and serve their first Meal of the Day, marking the Arrival of the 7th Day of Ramadan.</p>
<p><b>10:10</b> The War between the Zionists and the Palestinian Muslims had recently come to a halt, as the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Terran Emperor Musk, agreed to a Ceasefire—in hopes it will last throughout the rest of the Ramadan month.</p>
<p><b>10:11</b> Emperor Musk had already conquered one third of the Planet—starting from the North Pole, Greenland, Canada, Confederate America, Mexico—all the way South towards Venezuela, Australia and Zealandia—thereby establishing yet another Empire over which the Sun never sets. Much like its British predecessor.</p>
<p><b>10:12</b> The core Ideology of the Terran Empire was that of Human-centered Fascism; a prosperous and unified Human Race where the Strong ruled with an Iron Fist, at the Expense of the Meek and Frail.</p>
<p><b>10:13</b> Their number one Priority was the eradication of so-called ‘Third-World Genetics’ where People of Color, who were presumed to be of ‘Low IQ’, would be forced to marry and procreate with Caucasian Whites in order to ‘Lighten the Skin-Tones and brighten the Minds of the next Generation’.</p>
<p><b>10:14</b> Little did the Terrans realize that ‘brightening the Minds of the next Generation’ would result in the Creation of Individuals with rigid and coherent Moral standards, who would then go on to become highly effective Terrorists, Rebels and Trouble-Makers.</p>
<p><b>10:15</b> Many of the top leaders of Hamas were known to be College-educated ‘Augments’ who arrived at their Revolutionary Ideals through their ruthless Pursuit of Knowledge, as well as their striving for academic Achievement.</p>
<p><b>10:16</b> Some Palestinians believed that the ‘Augments’ were actually Human-Jinn Hybrids, seen as the Zionists themselves are virtually all possessed by the Jinn. In addition to being Hybrids, and Starseeds, themselves.</p>
<p><b>10:17</b> The aforementioned Kiranite Starseeds have been fighting the Zionist Starseeds for more than a thousand Years. Reincarnating at least once every 33 Years, or longer.</p>
<p><b>10:18</b> Kiranite Starseeds held Ancient Egypt to be an Ideal Civilization, whereas the Zionist Starseeds considered the Pharaoh and his Regime to be inherently oppressive, and responsible for enslaving and oppressing their Forefathers; Moses, and the Israelites—who had wandered the Deserts in search of a place to call Home.</p>
<p><b>10:19</b> Both Peoples were highly capable, and of great intellectual Prowess. </p>
<p><b>10:20</b> The Late Princess Khan, who had passed away at Ofer Prison in the Zionist-Occupied West Bank, was widely accused of being a Fraud, a Dare-Devil, and a War Tourist who leveraged her Political Activism in order to boost her Social Media Presence, as well as her Career as a Left-wing Journalist.</p>
<p><b>10:21</b> The Late Princess Khan had nonetheless experienced a renewed surge of public Interest in her personal Life as Details emerged about her Biography—which was loosely documented inside of her written Manifesto known as the Promethean Tenets; the Revelations of Allah to the Kiranite Prophet.</p>
<p><b>10:22</b> Public Opinion on Princess Khan had since shifted from Negative to Mixed within the Palestinian Lands.</p>
<p><b>10:23</b> “ROOSTER!!!” the little Girl shouted, just as she finished her Bowl of Muesli, Oat Milk and Dates. “COME OUT AND GET ME!”</p>
<p><b>10:24</b> “Stop it!” Elias, her older six-year-old Bother, yelled at her from across the Table. “Why would you purposefully ask for the Monsters to come and get you? Are you Insane?” he gestured by tapping his index Finger against the side of his Head.</p>
<p><b>10:25</b> “Because.” Alzira muttered, and dropped her dirty Spoon on her Apron. “I want them to come out NOW! [Not] when I am sleeping!”</p>
<p><b>10:26</b> “…My Girl is only 3 Years Old—and she is already a Warrior!” Princess Klea chuckled, and picked her Daughter up by the Shoulders.</p>
<p><b>10:27</b> “Honey, maybe we should sew the Blinds and Curtains permanently shut—so that this ‘Rooster’ stops coming into her Bedroom?”</p>
<p><b>10:28</b> “It makes no difference.” Alzira kindly explained. “Because even when you close the Curtains… In the Dream, the Curtains are wide open.”</p>
