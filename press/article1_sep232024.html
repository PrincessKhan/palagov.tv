	<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: green; background-color: rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.25);"><i>Last modified: 30th of September, 2024 at 12:10a.m.</i></p>
        <!-- <p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: white; background-color: rgba(250, 125, 75, 1);"><i>...UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!</i></p>-->
        <p><b>The Problem: Millennial Art Still Sucks</b></p>
        <p>It used to be that Art was our way of building meaningful connections with others, and stimulating both innovation and creativity in a way that would prevent us from engaging in armed conflict in order to settle disputes, and grievances.</p>
        <p>However &ndash; the bleak realization that everybody is subconsciously and telepathically arriving at (fittingly enough) is the fact that Art in the modern era has lost all of its meaning, and value.</p>
        <p>What this essentially means is that the very forms of escape that would have otherwise distracted us from ever having to ponder "The Whole Point of it All" are starting to crumble apart, leaving us with with nothing but a sludge of endless remakes and reboots that are so numbing to our brains, we now merely use them as background noise while we scroll for the latest Breaking News on our phones.</p>
        <p>You could literally make [any] movie you can think of, without even trying to reference any other movies as inspiration, and chances are &ndash; somebody will point the finger at you and accuse you of plagiarism, anyway.</p>
        <p>Because: "It's already been done before! THINK HARDER, you Loser!"</p>
        <p>And this applies not just to movies, but also: Philosophy, Music, Paintings, Drawings... <b>and even Human communication itself.</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p>The reason people don't bother talking to each other anymore, is because there is nothing left to even talk about. It's all been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> on places like Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok &ndash; you name it.</p>
        <p>What this means is that people now have to go to even greater lengths in order to make their voices heard, some even resorting to extreme acts of nihilistic terrorism, as well as Suicide, or self-harm (i.e. Nikocado Avocado).</p>
        <p>That's right: The only way to be an artist in 2024, is to self-harm, but not just self-harm &ndash; but to be a professional and relentless self-harmer. To douse yourself in such misery, and suffering, that NOBODY can ignore it.</p>
        <p>Consider the case of Aaron Bushnell &ndash; an American soldier who set himself on fire outside of the Embassy of Israel in Washington D.C. in order to protest against the genocide in Gaza &ndash; which went largely unnoticed on the internet.</p>
        <p>...Or the case of Wynn Alan Bruce, who also set himself on fire in Washington D.C in front of the Supreme Court building, as a way of drawing attention to our public apathy towards climate change.</p>
        <p>None of these acts have any real weight to them anymore, much less any of the mass shootings, or suicides. Because let's face it &ndash; in this day and age, [everybody] is crazy. So just as Art has lost all of its meaning, being 'Crazy' has also lost all of its meaning.</p>
        <p>And it gets bleaker than that &ndash; because by the time the nuclear missiles start dropping all over our cities, nobody will really have a <i>toss</i> to give. It'll all just feel like a scene out of an IMAX theater, not least because of the fact that we always see the mushroom cloud before the shockwave knocks us over. (Not that you should be staring at a mushroom cloud in the first place.)</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p>We are bored, overstimulated, and ungrateful from all the content we've consumed, and all of the cheap junk we've purchased online over the years, in addition to all of the french fries and BigMacs we've restlessly shoved down our throats, without even savouring it.</p>
        <p>It's gotten to the point where personal care brands like Dove are now starting to make advertisements featuring obese women &ndash; a monument to our collective gluttony, and love of Capitalism &ndash; while Palestinians on the other side of the world are brutally murdered, and starved.</p>
        <p>Then they have the nerve to call that "Activism".</p>
        <p>This world is disgusting on so many levels, yet the nightmare has only just gotten started, and who knows how many layers of Hell we're about to encounter as we progress in our journey through a post-Coronavirus wasteland?</p>
        <p>I would go as far as to call <b>Loneliness</b> the: Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse, due to the insidious manner in which it can destroy an entire civilization, and not just turn people against each other, but also render the creation of Tribes and Communes a thing of the past &ndash; because in the minds of the Western liberal, every Tribe and every Community is now a <i>cult</i>.</p>
        <p>Everything is a cult... except consumerism and psychiatry.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Organic Telepathy</b></p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why, every time you dream about a friend, or a relative &ndash; they almost [always] call or chat you up in the morning?</p>
        <p>That's because the way telepathy works is rather simple to describe, but complex to actually practise deliberately:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Game Theory can explain nearly everything about the way that sentient creatures and agents behave in their environment, what kind of decisions they're likely to make, and what kind of decisions they're guaranteed to make.</li>
        <li>A person is imagining hundreds of thousands of various different scenarios and possibilities as to what kind of decisions another person is likely to make.</li>
        <li>The subject of the person's imagination is likewise, also imagining hundreds of thousands of various different scenarios and possibilities as to what kind of decisions the first person is likely to make.</li>
        <li>Both eventually arrive at what I like to call the <b>Khan Equilibrium</b> through intensive and sustained focus, in which: "You know, that I know, that you know, that I know, that you know, that I know what you're thinking."</li>
        <li>The non-physical communication link is now established and sustainable.</li>
        <li>This assumes that both of the subjects have gathered a maximum amount of data about each other, while also being data hoarders and heavy consumers of media in their spare time &ndash; because the more data you consume about the world, and other people, the greater your ability to predict and understand them.</li>
        <li>There comes a point beyond which there's no point in consuming any additional content or data, <b>because the mind can now generate and predict it on the fly.</b></li>
        <li>This also explains why Art has become so stale, boring and predictable, even when we exert maximum creative effort &ndash; <b>because we've essentially reached a global, cultural Khan Equilibrium in the arts</b>, to the point where nearly anyone can now make their own fan-fiction and tribute songs of their own shows, movies and musicians, with or without the help of Generative 'A.I.' tools.</li>
        <li>Likewise &ndash; memes, jokes and viral YouTube and TikTok videos exhibit a sort of 'Meta-Modern' edge where, rather than being sincere and to-the-point in their messaging, they instead satirize the satire of the satire of the satire of the original idea.</li>
        </ol> 
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
         <p><b>The Compression of Ideas</b></p>

         <p>Most Gen Z and Millennials are fundamentally incapable of reading or finishing books, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp93x7lbuEg">and for good reason.</a></p>

<p>That's because their brains are already bombarded with so much information - that trying to take in any additional information would simply cause a high amount of stress and over-taxation of the brain, to the point where content now has to be 'condensed' and made into 'short form' &ndash; as in, ABSTRACT versions of complex ideas.</p>

<p>So rather than reading books, they will just read summaries of those books in the form of YouTube essays, or simplified audio-books (same thing I would argue).</p>

<p>...And rather than reading 1 book at a time, you can now read 100 books in 100 minutes by consuming the summaries of each of those books - and then transforming the conclusions and messages of those 100 books that you read in 100 minutes, into even more condensed conclusions and ideas with which you can now make even newer ideas.</p> 
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><b>Brain Rot, or Enlightenment?</b></p>
<p>Socrates, as recorded by Plato, once argued that books would ruin the youth and the generations to come, crippling their ability to remember. And in a way, you could say they were half right.</p>
<p>That's because for every book that you read, you're essentially digesting the glorified opinions and narrow perspectives of a single individual. You are also filling up excessive, valuable real estate on your mind with the contents of a single idea, because for every book that you read &ndash; there are hundreds of other books that you aren't reading, and you only have so much time to live.</p>
<p>This is why I'm willing to make the Unorthodox and academically sinful argument that we should [embrace] the condensation and distillation of content into even simpler content, as long as you can separate such simplified and distilled content into High Quality vs. Low Quality variations of each, so as to prevent the spread of misinformation and 'bad ideas' (if there actually is such a thing from your perspective, even though bad ideas can sometimes contain elements of truth in and of themselves).</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
       <p><b>Convergent Evolution: <br>Merging with 'A.I.' vs. <br>Becoming like 'A.I.'</b></p>
<p>Convergent evolution shows that similar traits emerge independently in different species facing similar challenges, which, again &ndash; can all be explained thanks to Game Theory.</p> <p>This mirrors how Human ideas and narratives reoccur in different forms across cultures and technologies, particularly as we evolve alongside 'A.I.' (which we refer to as 'Cognitive Computing').</p> <p>Plato‚Äôs myth of Tehoot, which critiques writing as a substitute for memory, exemplifies this recurring theme: tools that initially seem to aid us‚Äîlike writing or A.I. ‚Äî can lead to forgetfulness and detachment from wisdom.</p> 
 <p>This does not mean that leaning on search engines and cognitive computing agents is inherently bad, and as was explained in previous chapters &ndash; we should actually be embracing them, not cowering away from them, as long as we train ourselves to use them correctly.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p>The recurrence of similar narratives is apparent when examining how Humans approach knowledge and technology. Different cultures and eras have expressed the same core ideas, only through varying symbols and languages. The division of language, as Tehoot represents, created a barrier between people, yet the underlying truths remained the same‚Äîjust expressed in different forms.</p> 
<p>Cognitive computing may be a new "language" in this cycle, offering tools that, while powerful, risk repeating the same mistake of distancing us from genuine understanding. As with writing, "A.I." allows us to access and organize vast information, but risks making us forgetful, relying on the tool rather than fostering deep thought &ndash; much in the same way that books do. </p>

<p>This reoccurrence of narratives, whether through mythology, technology, or philosophy, suggests that we are always grappling with the same fundamental issues. The story may take different forms‚ÄîPlato‚Äôs critique of writing vs. today‚Äôs concerns about A.I. ‚Äî but the underlying theme remains. Modern substitutes for ancient problems.</p> 
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>True understanding and wisdom lies in recognizing common patterns and exercising our brain, much in the same way that an athlete would strengthen their body through repeated action, and conditioning.</p>
<p>It is for this reason I suggest we spend more time actually [thinking], rather than reading, or consuming content &ndash; and if content is to be consumed, then it ought to be heavily distilled, and also highly vetted so as to ensure that we're making the most of our precious time here on Earth.</p>
        <p>Instead of being consumers and creators of content and ideas, we will become [curators] of already existing ideas &ndash; so that those same ideas can be synthesized into newer and better ones, and then tested against reality.</p>
        <p>...And instead of using the Internet as a means of communication &ndash; we will no sooner become telepathic <b>supermen</b> capable of reading each other's minds.</p>
        <p>For we will essentially be able to conjure up an <i>imaginary audience</i> that can both applaud, and critique the Art that we create, as well as the ideas we communicate, all at once.</p> 
        <p>Everyone will be blessed (and cursed) with an internal voice that speaks to them 24/7, even in their dreams &ndash; thus creating a collective consciousness through which we can interact without the use of technology.</p>
