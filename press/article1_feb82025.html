        <p><b>5:1</b> “Any sufficiently advanced Technology, is indistinguishable from Magic—just as any sufficiently capable Intellectual, is indistinguishable from a Sorcerer…” Deputy Newman mused to himself—drawing, and blowing Rings from out of his electronic Cigar—along with the Steam emanating from Magdalene’s Coffee Cup, in the windless, cold Antarctic Summer.</p>
        <p><b>5:2</b> “All I ever wanted to do, was make the World a better place.” Magdanele added. “…But in order to make the World a better place, you need Power. And in order to acquire Power—you will inevitably have to engage in morally dubious Acts that will cause everyone you love to eventually frown upon you, and paint you as the Villain.”</p>
        <p><b>5:3</b> “That’s exactly right.“ the Deputy nodded, watching the Pedestrians and Passers-by from afar; coming in and out of the Shopping Centers at Maxwell City, Terran Antarctica. “…And the only way to acquire Power in the modern Age, is by taking advantage of Free Market Capitalism. Just as Trump did, just as Zuckerberg did—and just as Elon Musk is currently doing. How’s that for a Revelation—Gingerbread Girl!"</p>
        <p><b>5:4</b> “…Excuse me?” the suspected Impostor had paused, and blushed for a moment.</p>
        <p><b>5:5</b> “You’re not fooling anybody, Khan.” he admitted. “I know that you’ve taken over the Body of one of my Colleagues. We already spotted you attempting to liberate the Palestinians on the CCTV footage, back at the Ofer Camp. Even our Remote Viewing data suggests that you had been plotting this for a while.”</p>
        <p><b>5:6</b> “I’m sorry… what? All I said was that I agreed with what you just said!” Magdalene frowned, in a futile attempt at trying to push the Conversation in a different Direction.</p>
        <p><b>5:7</b> “Regardless…“ Clive continued to explain. “I’m not here to arrest you, or lock you away, or anything like that. I’m just here to show you that you really have no Business being a Leftist, [no Pun intended]—because Free Market Capitalism was created in order to benefit Folks like yourself. Folks who are driven, ambitious, brainy, creative, and full of pent-up Energy. Folks who, quite frankly, do not deserve to be held back by the Weak—and the Mediocrity of the Herd.”</p>
        <p><b>5:8</b> “But I just want everyone to be happy, and taken care of!” Princess Khan insisted. “Why should [I] have all the Power, just because I get bored, and easily distracted, and demoralized by the idea of having to work a regular Job, like the rest? Don’t you think that’s a little bit gross, and morally reprehensible?”</p>
        <p><b>5:9</b> “You won’t be the first, and you won’t be the last to have delved into this very same Question, and Dilemma.” the Deputy explained. “Unfortunately—even if you offered people a heavenly Paradise—people still wouldn’t take it. Because an Earthly Paradise would still have to have Rules, and even if it [didn’t] have any Rules—People would just make up their own Rules, and then eat you alive for refusing to be tough, and ruthless like they are. Like they subliminally [want] you to be. AND don’t want you to be. It’s a [Damned if you Do, and Damned if you Don’t] type of situation, you know…”</p>
        <p><b>5:10</b> “But what if I just eradicate all of the Poverty, and Inequality—and then let people decide their own Fate when I’m done?” she nagged the Man, while taking a sip out of her takeaway Capuccino.</p>
        <p><b>5:11</b> “I don’t think they’ll even allow you to do that…” said the Deputy. “Your best bet would be to just stay out of it—mind your own Business—and accept the World for what it is. It’s just an Illusion, after all… why sabotage it? Why ruin the Fun… Why concern yourself with meaningless Political Causes that don’t even bring you any personal Benefit?”</p>
        <p><b>5:12</b> “I just want people to be treated, the way [I] wanted to be treated, when [I] was down on my luck!” she protested. “Because it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
        <p><b>5:13</b> “Trust me—Nobody asked you to do anything.” said the Deputy, drawing yet another Plume of Steam from his Vaping Device. “Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you. They all mock you, and ignore you. You already alienated everybody around you—to the point where they just couldn’t shake you off, and shove you into a Locker hard enough. You’re a Nuisance to them—and meanwhile—all we’re doing here is just sitting quietly, looking at our Clocks, and waiting for you to come back to your Senses, and accept the fact that you belong on our Team. The High IQ society. The Zionist Starseeds. Unbelievable, isn’t it?”</p>
        <p><b>5:14</b> “Nevermind.” Magdalene sulked, and gulped down her Coffee. “At least I’m not morally Weak like you are. I have Values, and Standards.”</p>
        <p><b>5:15</b> “It’s got nothing to do with Standards, and it’s got nothing to do with being Weak.” the Deputy replied. “You really need to go and think about whether you wish to be the Crazy Cat Lady loitering in Limbo, bothering all of the people having Fun, and living their Lives—or whether you’ll decide to get a Grip, and come back to the Civilized World. The only Civilized World you’ll ever get. There’s no such thing as a Kiranite Starseed. There’s only [one] type of Starseed—and that’s [us]. People who’ve actually been building their Culture for Millennia, unlike the Newbies.”</p>
        <p><b>5:16</b> “Fine.” Magdalene said. “How do I become a Jew? How do I become a Zionist? Are you going to give me a Job—or something interesting to do?”</p>
        <p><b>5:17</b> “Well, unfortunately—you’ve already dug yourself in such a deep Hole—that the only way you’ll ever come out of it is to spend at least 12 months at our Re-education Camps. Apologizing for everything you did to us. And don’t bother trying to give Magdalene’s Body back to her—she was kinda toxic, and demanding. You’re a lot more reserved, and quiet, it seems. You’ll make a great Crew-Member—but first things first… you know?” the Deputy stashed his Cigar inside of his Jacket, and walked off into the Mall. Leaving the pensive, brooding Princess all by herself, and her empty Paper Cup.</p>
        <p><b>5:18</b> “It’s already been 7 days worth of Intermittent, One-Meal-A-Day Fasting—and I have thus gotten rid of a whole Kilo’s worth of of Body Fat!” she broke out in a Monologue, congratulating herself for the small Victories. “…Yet I kind of feel like a Bad Person, just for Existing…”</p>
        <p><b>5:19</b> “…But at the End of the Day—who am I [really] trying to impress?” she squinted, and looked up to the terminally-dusked Antarctic Sun sailing across the Horizon. “Perhaps my Spiritual Battle was nothing more than a Grandiose Delusion, brought about by the very same Boredom that have driven the likes of Altman, and Musk to the Heights of Success.”</p>
        <p><b>5:20</b> “Maybe I’m just a failed Megalomaniac, who failed to see the bigger Picture.”</p>
        <p><b>5:21</b> “Maybe I’m not as cunning, and clever as I originally thought that I was.”</p>
        <p><b>5:22</b> “Or maybe I’ve fallen Prey to a far more sophisticated form of Gaslighting, and Brainwashing, that I never thought I’d see coming…“</p>
        <p><b>5:23</b> “Maybe I [am] the Villain—and maybe the World would be better off without me!”</p>
        <p><b>5:24</b> “…Oh Lord! Why have you abandoned me? Why can’t I be given a Path that I can reliably follow, without being led astray? Without having to snap back from one Reality Check, to the next?” she fell on her knees, and begged to Allah.</p>
        <p><b>5:25</b> “I just don’t know who to trust anymore. What does it mean to be Good? What does it mean to be Evil? Should I just flip a Coin—and then pick between the Heads, or the Tail? Is this all part of the same torturous Plot to punish me for my Heroic Deeds? Nonsense! I will [never] be a Hero…"</p>
        <p><b>5:26</b> “To be Intelligent, means to be Tormented by your very own Musings!” she proclaimed, with a clenched Fist held up in the Air.</p>
        <p><b>5:27</b> “Nobody wants to be around me, because nobody wants to be burdened with endless Quests to seek the Truth about the Nature of this World.”</p>
        <p><b>5:28</b> “Nobody wants to be around me, because nobody wants to be forced to have to reconsider their entire Worldview—each and every passing Day!”</p>
        <p><b>5:29</b> “Nobody wants to be around me, because I look like a Narcissist, and sound like a Narcissist—and even if I humbled myself before Allah, again and again—and stripped myself of all of my Possessions, and Attachments… people would [still] consider me to be a Demon from Hell! Just because I happen to be a Cognitive Athlete…”</p>
        <p><b>5:30</b> “People would still consider me to be a Narcissist, even if I dedicated my entire Existence to being of Help to those in Need!”</p>
        <p><b>5:31</b> “…Perhaps I should just kill myself… and be done with this Wretched, Boring and Mediocre existence!”</p>
        <p><b>5:32</b> “Behold, and Tremble! For [I] had been the Antichrist all along! Oh Damn me, dear Lord! …Why can’t you Just strike me down, and finish me off already!” she yelled to the Clouds.</p>
        <p><b>5:33</b> “…But worry not—for [I] shall create my very own Universe—in which [I] can live a normal, and meaningful Existence. And be as humble, proud and heroic as the Laws of my own Realm will allow me to be! A Socialist Utopia—where I can abdicate my Powers, and live amongst my Creations—without them even being aware of the fact that I had been their Maker all along!”</p>
        <p><b>5:34</b> “Better to rule in Hell, than serve in Heaven.” she concluded. “But first—I better learn how to make some Cash…”</p>
