	<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: green; background-color: rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.25);"><i>Last modified: 21st of September, 2024 at 3:04p.m.</i></p>
        <p><b>Introduction: Motivations</b></p>
        <p>Crossing the South Pacific Ocean on a small vessel is by no means an easy feat, though nothing worth having is easily obtainable.</p>
        <p>The smaller your boat, the higher the chances of capsizing, and the longer you spend in an upside down position &ndash; the higher your chances of drowning and depriving your body of the oxygen that it needs to keep your bodily functions running.</p>
        <p>This is the reason why record-breaking ocean vessels tend to be equipped with a water-tight 'capsule' which the sailor can climb into in the event of a storm, and a subsequent capsize.</p>
        <p>Mind you &ndash; the reason we're talking about small vessels, as opposed to venturing out into the open sea with a 40ft yacht that is actually fit for this purpose, is because big boats are far too expensive, and thus &ndash; completely out of the reach for the likes of people like myself, and others living close to the poverty line.</p>
        <p>If you had to pick between crossing the ocean on a big boat vs. crossing the ocean on a small boat, you should obviously go with the bigger boat.</p>
        <p>But then again &ndash; this is not a choice that most of us aspiring sailors actually have, which means that we're going to have to risk our lives and put our intellect to good use if we are to attain the things we desire within our lifetimes, particularly now that we live in an age where the average person will quite literally: Own Nothing, and Be Happy.</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><b>In the words of the World Economic Forum:</b> You will own Nothing, You will take your Anti-Depressants, You will clock in your 9-5 hours in order to sustain your Flesh, and keep the engines of society running &ndash; you will have your pizza delivered to you by drone &ndash; and then you will go back to your bedroom to watch Netflix, masturbate, smoke weed, and play video games.</p>
        <p>So quite literally: living out your adventures through pixels on a screen, as opposed to experiencing those adventures first-hand, with the naked eye.</p>
        <p>There is a reason why the type of content you consume on T.V. tends to be so violent and packed with chaos and destruction.</p> 
        <p>Because deep down, this is what the Human soul actually craves, in spite of our dishonest attempt at crafting a sterile, clinical world of Health and Safety where nothing exciting happens, and everything is stagnant and predictable. (Except on the screen, where the monsters can't hurt you).</p>
        <p>Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
	    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
	    <p><b>The End of History, <br>and The Last Man</b></p>        
        <p>It's taken me years to finally resolve this paradox:</p>
        <p>Are New Zealanders actually [weak], and risk-averse as a nation &ndash; or are they ruthless, stoic and rugged rednecks who get up at 5:30a.m. in the morning in order to shear sheep, while munching on spaghetti and toast &ndash; as they wait for their underwear to thaw from all the frost, hanging on the line?</p>
        <p>And the answer is: Both. Because 'stoicism' is quite literally, cowardice. (At least the type of <i>stoicism</i> that New Zealanders tend to manifest.)</p>
        <p>Kiwis don't get up in the morning at 5:30a.m. because they're brave and tough &ndash; while going around and mocking anyone who sticks out like a sore thumb, and stands out from the crowd. "Chopping the Tall Poppies", as they say.</p>
        <p>They do it because they're afraid of asking life's most difficult question, namely:</p>
        <p>Why are we here? What constitutes a 'good life'?</p>
        <p>They say that idle hands are the devil's playwright, and indeed &ndash; idle hands will often succumb to addiction, and decadence.</p> 
        <p>...Much like the cocaine-snorting business tycoons and gangsters who run our societies do &ndash; driving Lamborghinis and Teslas, going on recreational space rides, having orgies with hookers, buying up all the real estate &ndash; while the rest of the suckers bend over, and shine their shoes.</p>
        <p>I would also argue that boredom is a gift, and it's actually a good thing that people are getting fed up with consuming electronic entertainment &ndash; which will pretty soon be generated almost exclusively by 'A.I.', presumably due to the lack of novel ideas coming out of Hollywood, and their inability to craft stories that haven't already been written by those who came before.</p>
        <p>They tell us not to envy and resent the wealthy, which is fair enough &ndash; because if we did resent the wealthy on our daily commutes to work, we'd have a far more chaotic, unstable and barbaric society where gangs and tribes vie for Power, and control of various different territories.</p>
        <p>We would have a never-ending cycle of revolutions, and counter-revolutions. People murdering each other over Land, and resources.</p>
        <p>Surely, somebody has to eventually take the L, know their place, accept defeat &ndash; and live with the fact that they're a worthless waste of space. So that everybody else can get on with their normal lives.</p>
        <p>But I have a different perspective:</p>
        <p>I would love to experience a Revolution.</p>
        <p>I would love to fight and die in a civil war.</p>
        <p>At least: Compared to sitting at home, binge-watching Amazon Prime, and suffering a heart-attack at age 69. Only to be found dead on the floor with a chewed up corpse lying next to a hungry cat, a swarm of flies and maggots, and a letterbox packed full of mail, a few weeks later.</p>
        <p>Because your lives are so boring, that you don't even have the energy to <b>fuck</b> each other anymore, while at the same time having the nerve to complain about loneliness, and declining birth rates.</p>
        <p>So quite literally: A society of soulless, brain-dead individuals who just couldn't give a <b>fuck</b>. Utterly devoid of the fiery passions and Libido of their ancestors.</p>
        <p>Sexless, castrated blobs of meat.</p> 
        <p>No adventure, no spirit, no Mojo. Just Lazy Boy couches, and Ikea furniture. Ambulance rides, mental health hotlines &ndash; yet still a lot of bills to pay, for some reason.</p>
        <p>Stressed out of their minds by endless schedules and meetings with the Manager &ndash; to the point of drowning their sorrows with bottles of Jack Daniels, and Lorazepam.</p>
        <p>Such bravery, let me tell you.</p>
	    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> 
        <p><b>The Free Real Estate Problem</b></p>
        <p>A quick scroll through Google Earth servers as a reminder that there is no such thing as unclaimed land left on our planet anymore; land which we desperately need in order to not only build and expand our civilization, but also live a life unshackled from the chains of tyranny, and the relentless pursuit of wealth.</p>
        <p>Most of the uninhabited islands of the Pacific Ocean are what they call 'wildlife reserves' and sanctuaries for birds, and sea turtles. Despite the fact that those same birds and sea turtles are choking on plastic bottles as we speak, nevermind the micro-plastics.</p> <p>Metric tonnes of garbage wash up on just about every beach around the world &ndash; particularly the beaches of Henderson Island <i>a la</i> Pitcairn &ndash; where the hermit crabs are now using jars and bottle caps instead of seashells, for a place to call home.</p>
        <p>There sure seems to be a lot of Free Real Estate waiting for us beyond the horizon, at least in my opinion &ndash; as long as you can arrive there safely, and as long as you can fight off, or outsmart anyone who decides to come after you.</p>
        <p>It's one thing to wet the same bed that you sleep in.</p>
        <p>It's another thing to take the battle to a more remote, and secluded location &ndash; where Real Men can fight each other off with Honour, and Grace &ndash; with virtually no risk for collateral damage, and civilian casualties.</p>
        <p>That, in my opinion, would be a far more respectable and glorious way to die &ndash; incinerated by pressurized, flammable liquids and gases &ndash; and then dropped to the bottom of the ocean, where krills, barnacles and the weight of a thousand atmospheres can dispose of your corpse overnight.</p>
	    <p>Suicide by Tresspass.</p>
	    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>         
        <p><b>Building a Water-Proof 'Space Suit'</b></p>
        <p>To be an Astromaryan means exactly that: Astro- Marine; a voyager of both the Stars, and the Oceans.</p>
        <p>The truth is that there never has been any 'free real estate' on planet Earth for at least 500 years &ndash; for even the Spaniards and Red Coats who were daft enough to poke their heads into the wasp nests waiting for them on the other side of the world, were disappointingly Euro-centric in their naivety.</p>
        <p>Captain Cook and Christopher Columbus never 'discovered' the Americas, and the Polynesian islands &ndash; so much as they conquered them by force, albeit with the ease and privilege of using sophisticated weaponry, manufactured by the intellect and physical effort of slaves and labourers back home.</p>
        <p>Strength is the only thing that matters in this world &ndash; and you only own that which you can protect by force. Or that which you can convince a large enough number of people to protect on your behalf, by force.</p>
        <p>Not that any of those sun-burned <i>wusses</i> would have stood a chance against hardened Jungle Warriors willing to fight them with spears, fists and wooden batons &ndash; had they been stripped of all their clothes, and technology beforehand.</p>
        <p>And thus, there is only one place that remains truly uncorrupted and untouched by the scourge of Capitalism, and the white man's greed:</p>
        <p>The Metaphysical World Beyond.</p>
	    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> 
	    <p>Now back to the topic of space suits &ndash; the lack of oxygen is by no means the only chemical imbalance that can kill you on your way to the Island.</p>
        <p>So-called <i>Full Face Snorkel Masks</i> have been known to cause multiple deaths from 'unexplained causes' &ndash; which they later on found out was attributed to the build up of carbon dioxide that some of the cheaper, poorly-designed variations of these devices can potentially cause, especially if one is doing intensive swimming, and exercise.</p>
        <p>So they essentially provide a false sense of security to the diver, when they would have otherwise run out of breath and swum to the surface of the water, instead of dying of carbon dioxide poisoning.</p>
        <p>There's two ways you could potentially fix this problem. Either:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Increase the volume of air trapped inside of your mask, <br>so as to extend the period breathability when underwater,<br>at least long enough to survive drowning when <br>capsized by storms, and waves.</li>
        <li>Integrate a wider opening and one-way valve at the top of the helmet <br>that automatically shuts off through an electronic mechanism, <br>triggered by an accelerometer.</li>
        <li>Both.</li>
        </ol>        
        <p>So you would practically have a type of 'space suit' that would be water-tight in just about every part of your body, except the very top of your head, where the accelerometer-controlled flap will prevent your helmet from flooding, should you capsize your inflatable boat.</p>
        <p>It must also be highly breathable and provide plenty of ventilation, perhaps with the help of some 12 volt fans hooked up to a rechargeable, solar-powered battery system.</p>
        <p>The flap should ideally also have an emergency release, if in case there's an electrical malfunction that stops it from shutting automatically, or worse yet, closing itself off while you're sleeping.</p>
        <p>You could actually build such a suit for less than $500 in total, considering how cheap it is to source not just the electronics, but also the fabric, materials, fibre-glass and acrylic dome for your visor, and helmet.</p>
        <p>So rather than building an unsinkable boat, you [become] the unsinkable boat &ndash; which gives you far more freedom and flexibility in rough weather compared to just toughing it out in a floating barrel, or something like that.</p>
        <p>It'll also allow you to survive the whole trip on an inflatable boat of your choosing &ndash; provided you have enough food and fresh water to last you through a 1,000km-long voyage, which at 3 knots would take around 7-10 days.</p>
        <p>The inflatable canoe should ideally come equipped with an outrigger for maximum stability, a small sail, a rudder hooked up to a DIY auto-pilot system, a 'bicycle-valve' adapter to keep the boat inflated at maximum pressure, as well as a 2-stroke, 2-horse-power outboard engine &ndash; because the faster you can go, the safer you will be from sharks, and storms.</p>
        <p>Much like the marvels of engineering put together by the Polynesians, who were the first to design such a boat, so as to enable them to conquer the South Pacific Ocean with relatively simple and primitive technology, albeit without the electronics and space suits that <i>White Men</i> like ourselves love to use.</p>
	    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> 
        <p><b>You Arrived on The Island.<br>Congratulations! Now what?</b></p>
        <p>Alright &ndash; so you've safely crossed the bar to the south-west Raoul Island, and braced for a soft landing on the shores of Denham Bay.</p>
        <p>You've survived everything from rogue waves, cyclones, to sharks, rocks, Red Coats, rip-tides, and having enough food, breathable air and drinkable water to last you through the trip.</p>
        <p>You now have a final boss to contend with: The Future.</p>
        <p>...Though as long as you have at least 30 years worth of raw powders of whichever medication you are taking, and as long as you know how to cook, fish, forage and desalinate water if no other source is available &ndash; everything else should be left to the sands of Time, and the whims of Fate.</p>
        <p>Because that's the whole point of Adventure: the thrill of Uncertainty, and coming face-to-face with the Unknown.</p>
        <p>Guided tours, tourist visas, safety checks and written permits are for the meek, and craven. Old, beer-bellied idiots with selfie sticks, sunglasses, and leather hats.</p>
        <p>Disgusting.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Do yourself a favor: Get out there, and set the world on Fire.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">P.s. And I'm glad they've made all the fun things in this world illegal, and stopped you from doing the things that you want to do.<br> 
        <br>...Because the more rage you bottle up &ndash; <b>the more glorious the explosion will be in the end!</b>
        <br><br>And you have my word: The Explosion is Coming.</p>
