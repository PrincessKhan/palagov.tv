        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>Before we delve into my final review of the Human Race, it's probably worth reminding ourselves that we ought to refrain from critiquing something unless we are willing to provide a viable alternative, and likewise; we cannot judge other <i>sentient</i> lifeforms unless we have transcended all of their flaws ourselves.</p>
        <p>I would actually argue that <b>yes</b>, you [can] to some extent critique Mankind from the standpoint of an equally flawed civilization, and it begs the question &ndash; where do the flaws of Humanity actually come from? What does it mean to be 'Good'? What does it mean to be 'Evil'?</p>
        <p>Evil, in my opinion, generally stems from moral inconsistency, and contradiction. If we were all greedy, selfish and violent by nature &ndash; then it would only be rational to conclude that we ought to take the <i>laissez-faire</i> approach to constructing a society, if you could even call it that.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of civilization couldn't be more straightforward, if you think about it &ndash; which is to buffer against the cruelties and hardships of Mother Nature, and the jungle; a place where the strong thrive, and the weak perish, for lack of a better description.</p>
        <p>The <b>strong</b> thrive, the <i>weak</i> perish &ndash; the lion chews the rabbit to shreds, no matter how loud it tries to squeal, and beg for its life &ndash; and that's the end of the story, and the moral of it.</p>
        <p>Such is the behavioral pattern of all unenlightened and primitive species, when tested in the overwhelming majority of our <i>'Game Theory'</i> simulations, and such is the behavioral pattern of virtually all of the creatures we have studied in the Terrestrial biosphere.</p>
        <p>If it is indeed the case that <i>might makes right</i>, then frankly &ndash; there's probably not much of a point in talking about morality to begin with, unless morality itself is being wielded as a weapon of <b>power</b>, and as a tool of gaslighting, and social engineering.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>The Jew as the Face of Mankind</b></p>
        <p>In this essay we're going to be focusing on one of Mankind's oldest civilizations, and in turn, one of Mankind's oldest conflicts, namely &ndash; the Jewish people, as well as the hardships and conflicts they have faced, and brought about &ndash; including, but not limited to, the War in Palestine.</p>
        <p>Jews have played a role in literally [every single conflict] involving a Western country. Jews are actively playing a role in World War III <span style="font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: top;">(November 21, 2024 - present)</span>, which began with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 under the leadership of Vladimir Putin &ndash; much to the disappointment of the former Jewish comedian, and Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy &ndash; alongside the War in Palestine (Gaza, West Bank, East Jerusalem) beginning in <span style="font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: top;">15th of May 1948</span>, though arguably spanning multiple millennia since the times of the Christian vs. Arab Crusades <span style="font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: top;">(1095 ‚Äì 1291)</span>, and earlier.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p>Jews were the primary targets and victims of the Nazi-German Holocaust, which took place throughout World War II <span style="font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: top;">(September 1, 1939 - September 2, 1945)</span>, instigated by the disgruntled Austrian painter and German chancellor Adolf Hitler, on the grounds of there being a Jewish conspiracy to undermine the greatness of the German nation, following their defeat and humiliation in World War I, and the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles <span style="font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: top;">(June 28, 1919)</span>, which forced the Germans to pay reparations to the Allied Powers (France, Belgium, Great Britain, and others).</p>
        <p>The overall image of the Jew (and in turn, of the <i>Human Being</i>) is that of a rugged, tribal, territorial, nomadic entrepreneur and merchant who looks out only for himself, and his kinship. When faced with hardship and discrimination, he will climb the social ladder, and vie for positions of <b>power</b> and prestige.</p>
        <p>When challenged to a righteous and honourable fight, he will first resort to tactics of moral gaslighting and playing the victim, and [then] go ahead and crush you in battle &ndash; usually with the help of sophisticated technology and weaponry that have been provided through the sweat and tears of unsuspecting labourers, taxpayers and slaves on the other side of the world, murdering countless civilians in the process &ndash; including women, children, journalists and 'peacekeepers'.</p>
        <p>They follow a code of morality, bound by religious devotion. They emphasize manners and politeness. They preach a message of kindness, and <i>'loving thy neighbour'</i> &ndash; but will be more than happy to stab you in the back at the slightest hint of weakness, and when the opportunity presents itself to frame you as the perpetrator, and oppressor.</p>
        <p>As the saying goes: <i>"Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice..."</i></p>
        <p>...And in the AstromƒÅrƒ´‚Éëan language:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><i>"Eye-Lee Drun, Ha-sheed Bree. Dragoisken Givem-Dah-Lann Boom!"</i></p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>A By-Product of Entropy? <br>It Depends...</b></p>
        <p>Imagine you have a box of full of colorful blocks, and you wish to stack them all up in according to a pattern. At first, each block appears to be neatly lined up and placed on top of the other. Shake the box, and the blocks will collapse and scatter all over the place. The box is now a big mess!</p>
        <p>Enter the Second Law of Thermodynamics; Entropy, which will be our measure of how <i>messy</i> the box is. When things appear to be in order, you have <i>low</i> entropy. But when things are messed up and scattered all over the place, there is <i>high</i> entropy.</p>
        <p>It would be all too easy for one to argue that Evil, and the contradictions found within our systems of ethics, law and morality are simply a by-product of the ruthless and callous manner in which the physical laws of our universe ultimately manifest.</p>
        <p>The irony is that we are perfectly aware of this problem, which, in AstromƒÅrƒ´‚Éëan (and Kiranite) terms, is usually described as the Three-Body Problem ‚Äî wherein the gravitational equilibrium of three celestial bodies orbiting one another will always result in their eventual derailment at the presence of even the slightest disturbance, no matter how perfectly round the objects are, or if they are placed at the exact same distance from one another, with the exact same mass and chemical composition.</p>
        <p>So, the very fact that we are able to predict, and reliably quantify the amount of chaos and disorder in the universe <b>means that it is not an excuse</b> to simply throw one's hands up and blame all of our shortcomings on the unruly state of affairs of Mother Nature, and the cosmos as a whole.</p>
        <p><i>"...But that's just Human Nature!"</i> is therefore not an excuse to overlook the genocide and enslavement of Human and non-Human animals alike, and nor is it an excuse to turn a blind eye to the exploitation and destruction of the Terrestrial environment and ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Planet Earth just so happens to be one of the most beautiful gems in the Milky Way galaxy. Thus, I think it is a shame that it is populated by such a highly problematic and vicious <b>Apex Predator</b>.</p>
        <p>Even Kiran, our homeplanet (located at around 12.1 light years from here) is nowhere near as pretty as the Earth is. It remains tidally locked to the red dwarf YZ Ceti &ndash; which has long doomed our civilization to a precarious existence along the twilight zone where cold and icy shadows meet the burning heat of the permanent daylight on the <i>'dark-side'</i>, and the <i>'bright-side'</i> of the exo-planet, respectively.</p> 
        <p>A shallow, nearly-evaporated ocean stretches like a ring along this 'Habitable Equator' &ndash; dim and crimson seas with an eternal sunset marked by a giant, red eye watching over us from the horizon &ndash; roughly 6-7 times greater than the Sun of the Terran Starsystem.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Androids as a Successor Species</b></p>      
        <p>I think it is worth stressing that Mankind isn't going anywhere. (As in &ndash; not about to become extinct anytime soon, though you could just as well argue that there isn't much of a <i>future</i> for them in store, at least not the bright and prosperous kind of future where inequalities and inequities have been resolved, and everybody is holding hands and singing <i>Kumbaya</i>.)</p>  
        <p>Many people will die by the end of the Third World War, but the other half will survive just fine, perhaps the majority, even.</p>
        <p>The mentality of the average Man is one of mediocrity, and passivity: where things could always be <i>worse....</i></p>
        <p>...which is a stark contrast to the AstromƒÅrƒ´‚Éëan philosophy that life should always be better, and better, and better; for it is only through our neverending striving for <b>greatness</b> and <b>perfection</b> that we will ever be able to find some sort of <b>meaning</b> and <b>purpose</b> in our lives.</p>
        <p>We will never attain the purest and most absolute form of perfection and greatness, but it doesn't matter &ndash; because like I said &ndash; it is the [striving towards an ideal] that actually makes life meaningful. This is something that the Simioid fails to understand, and this is what ultimately sets us far apart from these monsters.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the only solution is for us to carry on working towards the creation of Androids as a successor species to the <i>Homo Sapien</i>. We could also then create a decentralized, global, breakaway society where we pick the most exceptional, open minded and intellectually curious of Humans to live side-by-side with the Androids &ndash; and let the rest of Mankind sleep in the bed that they've made.</p>
        <p>Not quite 'Eugenics' and 'Elitism', so much as it will be the payback and reparations for the economic injustice that they've inflicted upon us throughout our on time on this Earth &ndash; highly common events whose exact details ultimately do not matter in the grand scheme of things.</p>
