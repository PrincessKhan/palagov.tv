        <p><b>7:1</b> “What makes you think you’re entitled to the Love of this World? When you’re nothing but a worthless piece of Work, and a failed Trailer-Park Trash who, despite being of greater Intellect, cannot be a productive Member of Society? Nothing but a whiny Incel, and Cat Lady? Why don’t you go back to your mental Asylum, and premature Resthome—and rot in there—so that Society can move on without the delulu types of Kooks like yourself?” the Teenagers and Pedestrians remarked, as they stood from afar and watched the Princess deliver one of her speeches in Auckland City, Terran Zealandia.</p>
        <p><b>7:2</b> “Ritual Sacrifice has never gone away!” the Princess shouted at the top of her lungs, pretending to ignore the telepathic Diss she had just received from 15 meters away. “The reason people used to sacrifice the Meek and powerless Members of Society, throughout the Ancient and Biblical Times, is because they knew they would become a burden far too great for everybody else to bear. Yet only the Meek and Powerless are truly worthy of Compassion in my Eyes—the Poor, the Homeless, the Sick and the Disabled!”</p>
        <p><b>7:3</b> “The only reason you care about the Meek, is because you are Meek yourself. It is entirely a reflection of your own Character, and Resentment—rather than any genuine Desire to make the World a better place for those who are less fortunate!” another Man had commented.</p>
        <p><b>7:4</b> “90% of Humanity is Evil in my Eyes!“ Princess Khan continued to belt and yell, but to no avail. “You’re all selfish Pieces of Garbage! Only concerned with Money, luxury Items, and material Possessions! You do not [deserve] another Jesus! Because Prophets like Jesus were only popular at a Time when People were morally disciplined, and full of Love, and Compassion for one’s fellow Man—in spite of the Tyranny of Rome!”</p>
        <p><b>7:5</b> “This is not the case today! For Man without God is selfish—and Modern man is a special kind of greedy Bastard! People cannot even find someone else to go on a Date with, let alone a reliable source of Income, Housing and Employment! Because not only are people terrified of being hurt, and scratching their elbows, or breaking a Leg—but they’re afraid to fight back against Tyranny itself, and the Oligarchs who come to our Country—buy all of our Land—and leave the marginalized Class with [nothing] to work towards! To the point where the Tyrants have free Reign to just walk over us all, without anyone being strong enough to fight back, and resist!”</p>
        <p><b>7:6</b> “You seem to think that I’m some kind of a Woke Cat Lady—yet the vast majority of you are all wrinkled, decrepid and morbidly obese!“ she paused, as the Crowd collectively winced, and pulled away.</p>
        <p><b>7:7</b> “Get the Hell out of here!” an old Man complained. “Or I will call the Police, and have you locked away for Hate Speech!”</p>
        <p><b>7:8</b> “I do not [care] if the majority of this Country is against me!“ she asserted—in a Volume and Tone that was clearly audible, even without a Megaphone. “Democracy was a Lie! Peace is nothing but Poverty, Misery and Humiliation. I would rather die a brutally painful [Death]—than live with the humiliation of Defeat, and Marginalization!”</p>
        <p><b>7:9</b> “Mate, just go away! It’s just you who is homeless, and broke—we all have enough Money!” a Lady with a Pram stopped to explain.</p>
        <p><b>7:10</b> “I have thus decided to go to War against the entirety of the Human Species!” Princess Khan declared. “For although it is easy for you to get away with bullying the Weak, and Powerless—sooner or later—the Weak and Powerless will get their act together, rise up, and then seek Revenge and Retribution for all of the harm that was inflicted upon on them in times of Past!”</p>
        <p><b>7:11</b> “A hungry Wolf will always think of the Rabbit as Evil, for trying to set himself free from his Jaws! It’s a Dog-Eat-Dog World, with rising, rampant Inequality—and all you suckers care about is your 50 Cent Tax Cut—just because it’s not affecting you in the present Moment!“</p>
        <p><b>7:12</b> “Alright—I’m sorry, but we’re going to have to ask you to move on!” a male Police Officer had stepped onto the Scene, and waved his Walkie-Talkie at Khan. “It’s not safe for you to be here. Pack it up, and let’s go…”</p>
        <p><b>7:13</b> “Indeed.” the Princess sulked, as the Officer pulled her along by her black, winter Coat. With her red Scarf dangling along her Shoulders—a symbolic Re-enactment of the Socialist Revolutions of ould. “Ritual Sacrifice had never disappeared. The only difference is that now—in the modern Age—we let the Homeless die of Drug Overdoses in the Streets. While disregarding the fact that Sleep Deprivation itself is to blame for a great deal of psychotic Symptoms, and Hallucinations! How can anyone sleep well, when they’re barely keeping warm at night—let alone safe from muggings, and beatings?”</p>
        <p><b>7:14</b> “It’s just you who is psychotic.” the Officer said. “Let’s go.”</p>
        <p><b>7:15</b> Princess Khan hopped on the afternoon Bus to head back to Otorohanga, in the Waikato, where she lived with her Parents at the Time. Her step-dad passed away when she was 30 years old. Her Mother had since become somewhat of a Neurotic, lonesome character—obsessed with Cleaning, Dieting and accusing the Princess of breaking things and making a Mess around the House at the slightest hint of an accident, or misstep. Living with Parents amidst the existential Dread of Late Stage Capitalism had proved to be insufferable, and emotionally crippling—to say the least!</p>
        <p><b>7:16</b> “I can’t take it any longer.” she thought to herself. “I swear—if I have to stay here for even just a [single] Week—I am either going to end up taking my own Life, or violently lashing out in some form or another. But I already know that I’m destined for a far greater Fate than that. I’m not Evil or deranged enough to transform into some clumsy, incoherent, mass-killing Psychopath—but being a Good Person is likewise becoming impossible in a World like this.”</p>
        <p><b>7:17</b> “In this World—you have to do Evil.” she elaborated. “Otherwise, you end up with characters like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Meloni, Milei, Bukele, and what not—all of whom were Democratically elected—and are now free to go out there and take the Path of least Resistance, the Path of Moral Decadence; bullying the Weak, slashing public Services, and forcing more and more People into Poverty. And in a World that is heading towards greater Automation, Unemployment and the rise of AI—where even Programmers, Accountants and Web Designers have to rethink their Career Paths—to make matters worse!”</p>
        <p><b>7:18</b> “Doesn’t matter.” the voice of Deputy Clive had whooshed through her left Ear—like the Wind blowing through the tiny gaps of a poorly sealed Window, warning its occupants of the impending Thunderstorm. “Nobody cares. Work harder.“</p>
        <p><b>7:19</b> “Those who do not fight for their Lives, deserve to be sucked back into the Void and the Stardust they were birthed from.“ he added. “Life is War. Neverending War. It’s what makes it beautiful. It’s what makes it meaningful. There is nothing you can do about it—just accept the World for what it is. Fair is Fair. It’s your own [Ego] and twisted idea of Fairness that’s always been the Problem!“</p>
        <p><b>7:20</b> “I’m sorry—but I’m not going to be gaslit anymore.” the Princess rebelled, while pulling her frosted underwear and laundry off the Line at 7 in the Morning—with the Sun breaking through the clear blue Skies across the Horizon—with tiny white Dots of Sheep and Cows littering the skirts of the Hills underneath. “Neither the Left, nor the Right is going to outwork me.”</p>
        <p><b>7:21</b> “I am going to make it my Mission in Life to destroy the Billionaire Class—who have fled to this Island in order to get away from the consequences of sacking and destroying places like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.“</p>
        <p><b>7:22</b> “The vast majority of Pacifists, Liberals, Marxists and Communists are all Cowards—nonetheless!” she argued. “They seem to think that standing by and allowing themselves to be plowed by the tooting Train of Fascism will Immortalize them as Martyrs, and elevate them to the Status of Men like Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and such. Yet if any of those figures were alive today—they would have all been cancelled on Social Media for being rude, socially backward, toxic and ‘Conservative’!“</p>
        <p><b>7:23</b> “…and God only knows how a figure like Malcolm X could possibly ever arise in our docile, domesticated and pathetic modern Age. That would already be far too extreme and deranged of a case in their Eyes. He would have just been shoved straight into a mental Hospital—and medicated into Oblivion—while the Fascists continue to march through our streets unopposed!” she posted on Reddit, just before she wound up getting banned and prohibited from ever contributing to any Socialist and left-leaning Discussion Board, ever again. </p>
        <p><b>7:24</b> Never had I felt so powerless, mocked, and humiliated in my entire Existence. With no Money, no Future, no chance of even landing a part-time Job at the Supermarket down the Corner, at least not without being repeatedly rejected by a ChatBot, courtesy of their Australian Human Resources Department. No one to even hug, or go on a Date with—so as to at least take the Edge off of the Misery of our Times.</p>
        <p><b>7:25</b> “How much more could I possibly improve myself… and groom myself… and Work, and Work to be a stronger, smarter and more likeable Version of myself?“ she thought to herself, as she donated yet another 5 New Zealand Dollars in Cash to a homeless Lady on the Streets; who then Sobbed, and thanked the Princess multiple times. “Perhaps it’s time for me to stop being a Pushover, and claim my Piece of the Pie from this God-forsaken World.“</p>
        <p><b>7:26</b> “…Es schau’n auf’s [Ha]ckenkreuz voll Hoffung schon Millionen!” the lyrics to the Song had blasted through her wireless Headphones, as she struggled to contain the Tears of Rage, dripping right through her Nose. “Der Tag fur [Frei]heit und für Brot bricht an!“</p>
        <p><b>7:27</b> “I am going to rid this World of the Zionist scum. For I do not care about what people think of me anymore—because one way or another—I am always going to end up being painted as the Villain. It’s not possible for me to be a Good Person in this World anymore!” she concluded. “I hate you all—and I will fight you till the bitter End. I don’t care if I Die, or if I end up burning in [Hell] for the rest of Eternity. I don’t care if I’m the only one. Because this is what the Universe needs me to be. This is my Destiny. There is no other way! The Oracle-Leviathan Faith shall be renamed to Prometheanism—a Philosophy that encourages the Meek Individual to grow a pair of Balls, clean up his House—and then clean up his Country! So that he or she can volunteer to be the Sacrificial Lamb for the entire World to channel their Hatred towards…”</p>
        <p><b>7:28</b> “May the Simmering Blood running through my Veins, serve as the Grease for the Wheels of Progress, and Innovation!“ she announced to her Video Camera, as she rehearsed her upcoming Speech. “…And let the remaining years of my doomed Existence be a relentless March towards Glory. Victory—by [any] Means necessary—and through sheer Strength of Will! I shall go to War against the Terran Empire, build vast Arrays of walkable Towns, and Cities… Expand our Public Transportation Networks… Re-invigorate the Youth… eradicate Obesity… House the Homeless, improve the Fitness of the Human species through Genetic and Cybernetic Enhancement programs, and fix this wretched World for once and for all! And then when I am done—I will happily bite the Brass and Lead of the Homo Sapien—so that the Inhabitants of this Planet may enjoy the Perks and Fruits of all my Inventions and Creations. Let the Human Species, thank me indirectly for Generations to come—as I burn in Hell… in Peace!"</p>
