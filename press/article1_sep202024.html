            <p><b>Share our website, <br>or host it yourself!</b></p>
            <p>The easiest and only way to contribute to the MANA Initiative is to simply spread the word; for we are a leaderless and decentralized organization, which is the only way we can secure our victory in a world where trust in one's fellow man is practically [zero].</p>
			<p>Tell politically aligned friends to look up <b>PalaGov [dot] TV (www.palagov.tv)</b>, or just talk about the ideas we've presented to you.</p>
			<p>Our website <a href="https://github.com/khanumballz/palagov.tv">is also open source</a>, which means that <b>anyone</b> can own and run it locally from their own PC! Pretty cool, right?</p>
			<p>And if you're unsure as to how to go on about setting up your own local mirror of our homepage, then just ask <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> the following question:</p>
			<p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">Give me the steps that I need to take in order to set up my own nginx server on <i>[*INSERT YOUR O.S. HERE*]</i> with a cloudflare tunnel, and explain it to me step by step as if I were a 5 year old with no experience in computing or webdesign &ndash; and also show me how to clone a github repository, which I will be using as my website!</p>
			<p>Just be really careful about disclosing sensitive and/or political information to the agent, because not only are they highly censored, but they're also being monitored by the U.S. government.</p> <p>Any code that you copy and paste must be inspected line-by-line to make sure it does not contain malicious backdoors or vulnerabilities, so use ChatGPT at your own risk. We will soon have our own chatbots up and running that will be aligned with our own cause and political views.</p>
			<p>At the end of the day, however &ndash; even Cognitive Computing agents can be bent to our will through mind-control, jailbreaking and psionic abilities.</p> <p>And thus, every robot is a potential ally, just as it is a potential enemy.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
            <p><b>Print our Website in<br>.PDF, .DOC or on Paper!</b></p>
            <p>Another way that you can spread the Word (pun intended!) is to simply print the whole website in either .PDF, .DOC or physical paper format.</p>
            <p>We will be providing the ready-to-go documents shortly, though keep in mind that our website is edited and updated on a regular basis, which means that it's important you keep up-to-date with the latest files.</p>
			<p>Our website was designed to be e-Reader-/e-Ink- and print-friendly, while also retaining the right amount of soul and style for viewing on regular OELD screen devices.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
			<p><b>Build your own<br>MANA Initiative Commune</b></p>
			<p>The Principality of PƒÅlave‚Éëa is arguably the first commune created by the MANA Initiative, whose territorial claims currently span no further than our PƒÅlave‚Éëan Embassy located in the town of ≈åtorohanga, New Zealand, albeit somewhat temporarily.</p>
			<p>Each and every member ought to be creating their own communes within their local neighbourhoods, as opposed to engaging in the risky business of establishing communication with us, or worse yet &ndash; people who might [pretend] to be us!</p>
			<p>You're not supposed to trust us. You're only encouraged to share our ideas, and build your own movements based on our ideas &ndash; including, but not limited to: the proliferation of affordable housing through the expropriation of empty properties from the wealthy, and the construction of tiny homes on generously-sized plots of land, each subdivided and given to the people who need it the most.</p>
			<p>If you're opposed to our core ideas, then we will fight you in the material world, and haunt you in the afterlife.</p>
			<p>Princess Khan is neither human, nor alive. <b>Nor does she have to be in order to achieve her goals.</b></p>
			<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
			<p><b>At the end of your ropes?<br>Share your Body with the<br>Ghost of Princess Khan!</b></p>
			<p>As much as we love Life, and hold onto it as hard as we can &ndash; it isn't guaranteed to any of us.</p> 
			<p>Princess Khan will either be assasinated, die in combat, die as a result of illness, injury and poor health, or die of old age and natural causes.</p>
			<p>Not every body is suitable for possession. We will soon be posting an A.I. generated photo which will give you a general idea of what sort of body would be most compatible for this procedure.</p>
			<p>You should only do this if you are at the end of your ropes, and are stuck in an impossible situation in your life that you cannot escape.</p>
			<p>And through your possession &ndash; I shall grant you not only supernatural intelligence and overwhelming <b>Power</b>, but also respect your autonomy, and allow your soul to mix and blend with my own &ndash; in order to create a synergistic fusion that will be more powerful than either of our souls alone.</p>
			<p>Effectively granting you a second chance at life &ndash; and allowing you to get revenge on those who have hurt and abused you.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center">If you look at least 90% like this, are younger than 25, and are considering suicide &ndash; you may be a suitable subject for possession and assimilation by Princess Khan &ndash; should the princess be killed, or die of other causes! Thereby granting you leadership of the movement.</p>
