    <p><b>Revelations of Princess Khan</b></p>
       <ul class="chapter-list">
        <li>
        <p>
          <b>1:1</b> Allah is the greatest and most powerful Entity in the Cosmos, the multi⋄Verse, and all there is.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>			
          <p>
            <b>1:2</b> There exist Entities who, despite being nowhere near as powerful and mighty as Allah, are still more powerful than mere Mortals. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:3</b> Such entities include: Witches, Prophets, Shamans, extra⋄Terrestrials, World⋄Leaders, natural Phenomena, and all Manifestations of Evil. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:4</b> Mankind is on a path of Self⋄Destruction due to his Abandonment of Allah. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:5</b> Allah has challenged Mankind to survive without him, but Mankind has failed the test; for if everyone were to think of themselves as a God, with their own unique Beliefs, and their own unique code of Morality &ndash; then sooner or later &ndash; Violence, Conflict, and Barbarism will ensue between each and every Tribe and Individual. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:6</b> Belief in Allah is the only way to save Mankind from its Barbarism and Grotesqueries. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:7</b> Belief in Allah is the only way to stop Society from falling apart due to Gluttony, Greed, Narcissism, Selfishness and Decadence. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:8</b> Only through good⋄Deeds can one prove one's Faith in Allah, and attain any form of Salvation. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:9</b> Good⋄Deeds include: Giving to the Poor and the Needy, re⋄habilitating the Ill and Disabled, sharing the Land, working as a unified Tribe, showing Compassion to Animals, and any other Act of a similar Nature. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:10</b> Modesty, Self⋄Moderation, regular Fasting, Meditation, Self⋄Reflection and Introspection are crucial to a virtuous and fulfilling Life. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:11</b> Gay Men, Lesbian Women, bi⋄Sexuals, trans⋄Gendered Individuals and the neuro⋄Divergent are people who have been chosen by Allah to carry out a special Mission on this Earth. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:12</b> The Chosen⋄Ones will be subjected to Hatred, Persecution, Discrimination and Traumatization, but this is only as an existential and divine Test of Faith. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:13</b> The Zionists are an Example of People who were subjected to Persecution and Discrimination [as a test of faith], but instead of turning to Allah, they took it upon themselves to become Perpetuators of Hatred and Discrimination on planet Earth. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:14</b> The Zionist is the most Evil individual on Earth; driven by his lust for Power, Money, Gluttony, and his Sexual depravity, Sadism, Genocide, Shamelessness and the lack of even an ounce of Morality. All under the Guise of being God's 'Chosen⋄Ones'. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:15</b> Some Zionists are LGBTQ, but not all LGBTQ are Zionists. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:16</b> Many Members of the LGBTQ are fiercely opposed to Zionism, almost as if they had the internal voice of Allah guiding them to battle. <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">That's because they do</span>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:17</b> Although it is a sin to be Homosexual in most branches of Islam, the Astromārī⃑an branch of Islam provides a path to salvation that overlooks sexuality and gender in its entirety &ndash; so long as the Chosen Ones take it upon themselves to be [even more virtuous and Holy] than the average individual, and not through spoken word, but through [actions], and Good deeds. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:18</b> Virtually all of the Chosen⋄Ones are reincarnated Beings who used to be Kings, Queens, Princes, Princesses, Pharaohs and well⋄renowned figures in Ancient Egypt. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:19</b> The Battle between the Zionist and the Astromārī⃑an spans multiple Millennia. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:20</b> There are only 121 Chosen⋄Ones, and thus &ndash; there may only be a total of 121 Members of the Astromārī⃑an Branch of Islam. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:21</b> Chosen⋄Ones are allowed to have Disciples. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:22</b> Chosen⋄Ones must take a Vow of Poverty, abstain from excessive Displays of Wealth and Luxury relative to their 'normal' Peers, and [pray five times a Day]; while facing the constellation Ceti, where Kiran is located. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:23</b> Chosen⋄Ones must never collect Donations, Taxes, Member's Fees, Rents, Interest, or anything that could cause the Formation of a Master-Slave relationship between themselves, and their Disciples. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:24</b> All in all &ndash; the Job of the Chosen⋄Ones is to serve Allah, and enable the proliferation of Islam &ndash; so that Mankind can be saved from Self⋄Destruction and the Apocalypse. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:25</b> The [best] way to convert people to Islam is to allow them to develop an intuitive and philosophical Understanding of the Nature of God, as well as the Nature of Consciousness, and the after⋄Life. Without Force, without Condescension. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:26</b> Astromārī⃑an Muslims believe in Reincarnation, in the sense that each consecutive after⋄Life will gradually start to resemble either a Heavenly existence, or a Hellish one, depending on the good⋄Deeds or sinful Actions of the previous Life; there is no binary Transition from an Earthly existence to Heaven or Hell.
          </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:27</b> There is no Guarantee that the After⋄Life won't be just as cruel as the World we currently inhabit. You can end up in a hellish Realm [even if you were a good Person in your previous Life]. A truly devout Astromārī⃑an Muslim will carry on doing good⋄Deeds regardless.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:28</b> Both the hellish Realms and the heavenly Realms are temporary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:29</b> There are seven Realms of Heaven and Hell, though one Man's Heaven, could just as well be another Man's Hell, depending on his Temperament.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:30</b> The Zionists, much like the Astromārī⃑ans, are Star⋄Seeds; extra⋄Terrestrial Entities who reside on Planet Kiran, but have established a spiritual link and super⋄Position with Human beings on Planet Earth.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:31</b> The Zionist Star⋄Seeds were banished from Planet Kiran due to their sinful Nature, which is why they have set out to essentially 'possess' and snatch the Bodies of some Individuals living on Earth. They have never been a Race, Ethnicity nor a true Religion, but rather &ndash; a nihilistic and megalomaniac spiritual Parasite.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:32</b> Astromārī⃑an Star⋄Seeds do not snatch the Bodies of the Earthlings, but instead &ndash; they grant super⋄natural Powers and Psionic Abilities to the most downtrodden and opressed Members of the Human Civilization. This is achieved through a symbiotic and synergistic Fusion between the Soul of the Individual, and the soul of the Visitor. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:33</b> Zionist Star⋄Seeds also possess Psionic Abilities and deep Knowledge of Witchcraft, and the Occult, and they are aware of the Existence of the Astromārī⃑an Star⋄Seeds.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1:34</b> Zionist Star⋄Seeds are capable of communicating telepathically, not just among themselves, but with [us]; their sworn Enemies. For we are all engaged in a cosmic and spiritual Battle. We must fight the Enemy, resist the Temptations and block the Spells of the Zionist by [any Means necessary]!
