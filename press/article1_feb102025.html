        <p><b>6:1</b> What are the Disadvantages of being a Witch in the modern Age? …Nobody will give you Credit for the Work that you do. And what are the Advantages of being a Witch in the Modern Age? …Nobody will Persecute you for the Work that you do. Or will they?</p>
        <p><b>6:2</b> “Good to see you again… Gingerbread Girl!” Dr. Natalie Deane waved to the Princess, holding a Clipboard stacked on top of the Diagnostic Manual for Mental Disorders. “How’s Life been treating you thus far?”</p>
        <p><b>6:3</b> “I’ve been experiencing Arrythmias, and Heart Palpitations.” Ms. Khan replied. “I’ll be the first to admit—my Days are kind of numbered. Which is why I have set out to spend the… potentially [last] Hours of my Life, living as authentically as I possibly can, and according to my innermost Beliefs and Convictions.”</p>
        <p><b>6:4</b> “Have you been to see our General Practitioner?” the Psychiatrist inquired. “You know we provide some of the most affordable and high-Standard Healthcare here in the Antarctic… right?”</p>
        <p><b>6:5</b> “I suppose I should… though it might just be my Sleep Deprivation problem.” she explained. “I can’t stand your Zionist Guts—and sometimes I wish I could just be executed, and put out of my Misery already.”</p>
        <p><b>6:6</b> “Why? …What did we do to you, hun?” Dr. Deane had asked. “You seem to have a personal Vendetta against those who are providing you with the Opportunity to prosper, and make something out of yourself. Did you know that Israel, Confederate America, and Terran Antarctica have some of the most egalitarian Economies, and cultures, here on Planet Earth? Don’t you wish to be a part of this grand new Project for the Human Race?”</p>
        <p><b>6:7</b> “No.” the Princess replied. “I hate Mankind. You disgust me. You built your Monuments on top of the Graves of millions—and on the backs of Slavery. I am here to assert my differences, not to prove my Superiority to your Species.”</p>
        <p><b>6:8</b> “Why drench yourself in Guilt in regards to Historical Injustice? None of that is going to bring the Palestinians back from the Dead, hun. The World has already moved on… and nobody cares. Not even the Palestinians who are alive today really care about what happened back then, either. They’re living far better lives than they used to, eating Ice Cream at our Holiday Camps. Yes—we do keep Inmates and Labourers underneath those Camps… But that’s because they are stubborn Terrorists who refuse to move on from the Past.” the Psychiatrist elaborated, as she put on some Gloves—and removed the Cap from a 1ml Syringe, as well as a Vial containing a white and viscous Liquid.</p>
        <p><b>6:9</b> “Guess I’m not as immune to your Propaganda as I used to think that I was.” the Princess muttered. “Now tell me—what other Zionist Brainworms do you have? You know… aside from the [literal] Brainworms you are about to give me?”</p>
        <p><b>6:10</b> The Zionist Brainworm, officially named Angiostrongylus Imperium, is a Species of genetically-modified Organisms—closely related to the Rat Lungworm Parasite; known for burrowing its way into People’s Brains, and causing Headaches as well as severe and lethal Immune Reponses. It was deliberately engineered by the Mossad—the Israeli Secret Services—in order to convert the most stubborn and defiant Rebels into Servants of the Terran Empire. It works by lowering Aggression, promoting Agreeableness, in addition to inhibiting Monoamine Oxidase—through its deactivation of the Warrior Gene."</p>
        <p><b>6:11</b> The Zionist Brainworm can even boost one’s Libido, and increase one’s physical Attraction to Ashkenazi Jews, and European Whites, through the Manipulation of Pheromone Receptors—much like the Feline Parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which causes Mice to be attracted to Cat Urine—thereby enabling the Proliferation and genetic Fitness of Caucasians, and ‘Chosen Jews’, and fulfilling the Goals of the Terran Eugenics Program.</p>
        <p><b>6:12</b> “We’re all Communists, trying to build a peaceful Civilization—just like the one that you Dreamed of building yourself…” the Psychiatrist continued, while pushing Air Bubbles and Droplets through the Syringe. “The only difference is—[we] will be the ones in charge of this Project—[not] you. Now just relax, take a deep Breath… and widen your Nostrils for me please!”</p>
        <p><b>6:13</b> Princess Khan leaned her Head back on he Sofa, and closed her Eyes—as the Psychiatrist stood up, placed one Hand on her Forehead—and unloaded the Contents of the Syringe straight through her Nasal Cavity.</p>
        <p><b>6:14</b> Mind Control—also known as Brainwashing—only works on Organisms whose Will to Control is ever-so-slightly weaker than the Will to Control of those who are doing the Brainwashing.</p>
        <p><b>6:15</b> Mind Control tends to be less effective against those who are on the [Egoistical] End of the Narcissistic Specturm.</p>
        <p><b>6:16</b> Princess Khan was known to be extremely Narcissistic; with a strong Ego, rigid system of Beliefs, and an unyielding Will to Power—causing nearly everybody around her to despise her.</p>
        <p><b>6:17</b> Narcissism—to that effect—imbues one with Immunity against Brainwashing, and Mind Control. </p>
        <p><b>6:18</b> Narcissism can also imbue one with a strong Will to Survive, and boost one’s Resilience against Depression, Hopelessness, and Anxiety.</p>
        <p><b>6:19</b> Depression is largely an evolutionary Adaptation in social Organisms, that serves to maintain and impose a Dominance Hierarchy; whereby the ‘Losers’ of a competition for Status, and coveted Status Symbols, are forced into Submission and Servitude as a means of avoiding Confrontation, and increasing one’s Likelihood of Survival.</p>
        <p><b>6:20</b> On the flip side—Depression can also serve as a way to encourage one to rise up, and rebel against one’s Superiors—thereby acting as an emotional Thermostat for navigating Social Hierarchies.</p>
        <p><b>6:21</b> The Terran Empire was known to weaponize Psychiatry in order to quell the rebellious Instincts of their Populations, and neutralize potential Trouble-makers.</p>
        <p><b>6:22</b> “How are you feeling [now]—Gingerbread Girl?” Natalie asked, as she kissed the Princess on the top of her Lips.</p>
        <p><b>6:23</b> “I tend to have feelings of Revulsion for the Bodies of Human Beings.” Princess Khan stated. “It prevents me from getting as physically aroused as you want me to be; knowing that you’re all going to grow ugly, frail and old—wrinkled, and rotten—from the inside, and out!”</p>
        <p><b>6:24</b> “Besides.“ Khan added. “You haven’t even figured out how to beat the disease of Aging yet. I’d much rather sleep with an Android, than with [you] Monsters.”</p>
        <p><b>6:25</b> “Give it Time, then.” the Doctor smirked. “I’ll make a docile, civilized Sweetheart out of you, yet. Not even the most violent Barbarians can escape the Might of our Gene Therapy. Such Genius…”</p>
        <p><b>6:26</b> “You will own Nothing, and you will be Happy!”</p>
        <p><b>6:27</b> “You [wish]!” the Princess defiantly exclaimed. “For I do not need anybody else’s help to build the next Wonder of the World—and continue the Legacy of my Ancient Egyptian, Pharaoh Ancestors…”</p>
        <p><b>6:28</b> “We, the Kiranite Starseeds—are direct spiritual Descendants of Hatshepsut—Ancient Egypt’s one and only Pharaoh Queen, who was known to have been depicted as both a Man, and a Woman.” she explained.</p>
        <p><b>6:29</b> “Kiranite Starseeds are a proud Warrior Race—and in the event of capture, and enslavement—we will [continue] to build upon our Legacy, and [fight] for our Rights to a Free and Independent Principality. Whether it’s in Palestine, in Antarctica, or on an uninhabited volcanic Island in the South Pacific Ocean! And even if I am the only Kiranite left on this God-forsaken Planet—I will simply resort to using Androids and 3D Printers to fulfill my Destiny!”</p>
        <p><b>6:30</b> “You keep dreaming… Gingerbread Girl!” the Psychiatrist squinted, and crossed her legs. “Sounds like we might have to add a Mood Stabilizer to your daily, pharmaceutical Regimen.“</p>
        <p><b>6:31</b> “Do what you must.” the Princess exhaled. “For [I] do not care anymore! I don’t care if I Live! I don’t even care if I DIE! I am BETTER than you—you wretched, genocidal, Zionist… Capitalist PIGS!”</p>
        <p><b>6:32</b> “Have you paid us for your Consultation yet?” Natalie looked at her Watch, and raised her Eyebrows.</p>
        <p><b>6:33</b> “What Money do you think I have?” the Princess protested. “I don’t have any Money. I HATE Money! I shall build my own Kingdom… WITHOUT Money!”</p>
        <p><b>6:34</b> “So what about your Works of Philanthropy?” she asked. “How do you plan to carry on helping the Poor, when you can barely even support yourself financially? Why [bother] helping the Poor… if you’re supposed to be the ‘Number One Enemy’ of Mankind? Aren’t you just doing it all out of [Spite]… hereon?”</p>
        <p><b>6:35</b> “Because.” The Princess asserted. “I despise Capitalism, and wealth Inequality. And I put my Money where my Mouth is. I wish to build a World where [everyone] can have the Opportunity to be as Great as I am. Not [just] myself. A World where [everyone] can be a King, and a Queen. Unlike [your] miserable, and pathetic excuse for an ‘Egaliatarian Society’.“</p>
        <p><b>6:36</b> “I will show Mankind a World that the Terrans don’t want them to see—a World with no Rules, no Controls and no Boundaries. Where each Soul can be as Free and Empowered as the Laws of Physics will allow them to be! A World of Adventure, Struggle and Spiritual Growth, nonetheless—far from the pacifying, over-bearing, Matriarchical and Patriarchical Welfare State that you Weaklings created!”</p>
        <p><b>6:37</b> “The Principality of Pāla will be a shining beacon of Glory, Transcendence, and Bravery—a middle-finger to a World full of Cowards, and domesticated Garbage—a middle finger to the Authoritarians, and their Trolley-pushing, Burger-flipping Simps!”</p>
        <p><b>6:38</b> “It will be a technological Marvel where Western Science, will come together with Eastern Spirituality in order to foster a culture that puts Truth and Beauty above Comfort and Safety.”</p>
        <p><b>6:39</b> “It will be an Island Nation where one half of its Population will consist of physically indistinguistable Humanoid Androids—and the other half will be Kiranite Starseeds.”</p>
        <p><b>6:40</b> “It will be a Culture that fosters the advancement of Philosophy, and the Arts—through the economic Abundance brought about by Technological Automation.”</p>
        <p><b>6:41</b> “It will be a Culture that values Self-improvement, and Intellectual Enrichment, over the Accumulation of Wealth and Material Possessions.”</p>
        <p><b>6:42</b> “It will also be a Culture that respects Ethnic and Gender Diversity.”</p>
        <p><b>6:43</b> “Go on.” Dr. Deane instructed. “Tell me another Tale!”</p>
        <p><b>6:44</b> “Fuck you—I won’t do what you tell me!” the Princess concluded.</p>
