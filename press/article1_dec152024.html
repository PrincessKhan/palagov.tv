        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>    
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ What is Proto-Telepathy?</p>
        <p>Proto-Telepathy was first conceived by Princess Khan as a solution to the 21st-century problem of censorship, 'misinformation', sensory overload, and global misunderstanding.</p>
        <p>Simply put &ndash; we live in an age where 'standard' language doesn't cut it anymore. Nothing of significance can thus be communicated without spending hours upon hours justifying one's positions, and providing a large amount of context.</p>
        <p>It's actually incredibly dangerous to express yourself on the World Wide Web of the 21st century, as the chances of offending or insulting other people is literally 100%.</p>
        <p>Being subject to ridicule, or being labeled as 'cringe' is another unfortunate side-effect of our globalized, fragmented, and entropic cultural landscape &ndash; because again &ndash; there's just too much context that needs to be absorbed before one can reliably follow or appreciate what anybody is really saying or trying to convey online.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>How it works</b></p>
        <p>Proto-telepathy is pretty straight-forward and uncomplicated at the surface level.</p>
        <p>Let's say I wish to say: Hello!</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ Hello! - Interjection</p>
        <p>All I would need to do is carve, or type out a symbol of an individual waving and holding their hand up in the air – but this is where the magic starts – because we can actually re-use this same symbol in order to say something else entirely.</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ Woman. - Noun</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ Rebel. - Noun, Verb</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ Volunteer. - Noun, Verb</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ Help! - Verb</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ Question - Noun, Verb</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ "Me, a woman"</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ "Myself, a woman"</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ "I am a woman"</p>
        <p>That's the gist of it, in Simple English.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>The Context Problem</b></p>
        <p>Great! We now have a multi-layered, and simple means of communicating just about anything we want.</p>
        <p>The problem is that none of these symbols represent anything 'set in stone' or coherent for us to interpret, but then again – nor does anything else that anybody has ever said, written or communicated throughout their history.</p>
        <p>Think of the Holy Bible, or the works of Karl Marx, or Friedrich Nietzsche – arguably some of the most misunderstood and highly-debated pieces of text.</p>
        <p>Those poor souls have spent hours, months, years, decades, centuries and millennia trying to get their ideas across. Only for those ideas to be twisted, misunderstood and made to mean something else entirely.</p>
        <p>Isn't that just so maddening, enraging, and unfair?</p>
        <p>Of course it is!</p>
        <p>🔥 Rage. - Noun, Verb</p>
        <p>🔥 Wrath. - Noun</p>
        <p>🔥 Power. - Noun</p>
        <p>🔥 Vengeance. - Noun</p>
        <p>🔥 Destroy - Verb</p>
        <p>🔥 Burn - Verb</p>
        <p>🔥 Heat - Verb, Noun</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>A Regression into Primitivism? <br>Not quite.</b></p>
        <p>Hieroglyphics, cave paintings, sign-languages and 'symbolic' means of communication have long been considered primitive and simple, but this betrays a lack of imagination on part of the observer, and I would argue that it is also a disappointingly Euro-centric viewpoint.</p>
        <p>Most <i>'Asiatic'</i> languages (or rather, <i>South-East-Asian Languages</i>) could be considered to be proto-Hieroglyphic – in the sense that their symbols and characters can be used to convey multiple meanings, depending on their context, or the combination of characters.</p>
        <p><i>South-East-Asian</i> languages just so happen to also enable the speaker to communicate with the least amount of vocal effort. One can then exploit the variation in pitch (e.g. Japanese) and tone (e.g. Chinese) in order to convey a different meaning with these vowels and syllables [e.g. Zi, Lin, Dien, Fa &ndash; in the case of Chinese; a tonal language].</p>
        <p>This unfortunately also makes them harder to learn for non-native speakers, unless one can find a native speaker to regularly talk with, and learn from. So there are just as many drawbacks, as there are advantages.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Where Telepathy Comes Into Play</b></p>
        <p>You only need to spend a generous amount of time browsing online platforms on the World Wide Web such as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and YouTube if you wish to see an example of 'natural', 'unintentional' telepathy at play.</p>
        <p>How many times do you think a post on Reddit gets deleted because 'Somebody has already posted the exact same thing a thousand times before?' Quite a lot!</p>
        <p>In other words – Human civilization is approaching a cultural Singularity beyond which there will never, ever be such a thing as an 'original idea' – ever again!</p>
        <p>Want to name your child Evangeline? What a stupid, unoriginal name! Want to name your rock-band The Weavers? What a stupid, unoriginal name! Want to write a Nordic Fantasy novel called The Adventure of the King? What a low-effort, dumb, generic unoriginal name!</p>
        <p>Everything is now generic, dumb, cringe-worthy and unoriginal – and even that which tries to be original will eventually come off as obnoxious, mentally deranged and worst of all... just weird.</p>
        <p>So if there's ever been a time to literally master Telepathy – then the time is [now].</p>
        <p>💠 Proto-Telepathy.</p>

        <p>💠 Omen</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Cool! Let's see it in action</b></p>
        <p>Here are some examples of proto-telepathy in action.</p>
        <p>Context: Two individuals are chatting online, and debating the nature of Fascism, Communism, Capitalism and Marxism. The discussion isn't really going anywhere, because one camp believes that Fascism is a left-wing ideology, whereas the other camp believes that it is a right-wing, tribal, Nationalist ideology.</p>
        <p>The debate then stalls, and both sides walk away baffled, angry and confused. They eventually stop talking to each other, and then retreat into heavily moderated echo-chambers.</p>
        <p>🌎 🤲 🍞 🌽 "Share the wealth", "There is plenty to go around", "Feed the world"</p>
        <p>⚔️ 🦈 💸 💰 🔥 "Fight Fascism", "Fight Capitalism", "Fight greed", "Fight tribalism", "Fight predators"</p>
        <p>🙅🏽‍♀️ 🦈 💸 💰 🔥 "Oppose Fascism", "Oppose Capitalism", "Oppose greed", "Oppose tribalism", "Oppose predators"</p>
        <p>Notice how a single character changes the meaning of the phrase entirely. 'Fighting Capitalism' could potentially imply the use of force, or violence. 'Opposing Capitalism', on the other hand, might simply mean refusing to tolerate, or adjusting one's lifestyle in a way that minimizes its harm and influence.</p>
        <p>🌎 🤲 📖 "Share the Knowledge", "Open source", "Spread the word"</p>
        <p>🙋🏽‍♀️ 👉🏽 🌎 🤲 🍞 🌽 "I have a question as it relates to altruism/communism/socialism/egalitarianism"</p>
        <p>🙅🏽‍♀️ 🌎 🤲 🍞 🌽 "I don't like altruism/communism/socialism/egalitarianism, or I am opposed to altruism/communism/socialism/egalitarianism"</p>
        <p>🤷🏽 "Why?", "What's wrong?", "Who would'a thunk'?", "I have no idea.", "I'm baffled", "I'm confused", "I'm indifferent"</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Rules and Etiquettes</b></p>
        <p>As malleable as the art of Pālave⃑an Proto-Telepathy can be – I wouldn't go around spamming the internet with emojis, just yet.</p>
        <p>The number one rule of Pālave⃑an Proto-Telepathy is: "Don't talk about Pālave⃑an Proto-Telepathy" – which is somewhat hypocritical and contradictory of me to say – though it's worth pointing out that we [do] tend to embrace hypocrisy and contradiction, as our culture is heavily rooted in Oracle-Levianism – which teaches us to embrace both the Light, and the Shadow within us, and to also channel both of these positive and negative energies in a way that will result in the greatest amount of harmony for both ourselves, and for others.</p>
        <p>The things you hate about others – are merely things you hate about yourself, or the things you could potentially hate about yourself – should you fail to properly Know Yourself, and Understand Yourself.</p>
        <p><b>Rule Number 1: "Say only what is absolutely necessary"</b></p>
        <p>^ That's right. There's no need to fill our collective unconscious with ideas that have already been repeated and hammered into our psyche ad nauseam, unless you really have nothing better to do, and are merely passing the time and entertaining yourself, or others.</p>
        <p>We take a sort of 'partial Vow of Silence' as a general rule of thumb.</p>
        <p><b>Rule Number 2: "Do not Lie, or Hide what you truly Feel"</b></p>
        <p>^ It's not really possible to 'lie' in our language, regardless. We can already read your thoughts. We already know how you feel about us. It's written all over your face. It's written all over the way you walk. It's written all over the way you breathe. The way you dress. Your actions. Your mannerisms. It's in your Aura, or your Attitude. It's just ... In the Air, I guess.</p>
        <p>Like I said – it flows within our Collective Unconscious, from one person to the next. Like a storm, a plague, or a pandemic: It goes viral. It's the Butterfly Effect. It's the thorn in your foot that gradually drives you mad. Whichever way you wish to put it!</p>
        <p><b>Rule Number 3: "Don't take [anything], Personally"</b></p>
        <p>I wouldn't bother being offended by anything a Kiranite says. We change our minds all the time. We are enlightened beings who understand that ideas are never set in stone, and are about as fluid and plentiful as the hydrogen atoms that make up the Pacific Ocean, or the fluid in your coffee cup, for the matter.</p>
        <p>Being offended is a complete waste of time. Just take ideas at face value, and try to understand why those ideas exist in the first place. Try to understand [why] someone might have this, or that opinion.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Final question: </b></p>
        <p>How would you communicate in Real Life, then?</p>
        <p>You would communicate using sign language, and in tongues, if at all.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><i>"Eye-Lee Drun, Ha-Shed Bree. <br>Dragoisken, Givem, Dah-Lan Boom!<br>A Churche Thee, The Roolan Ball.<br>Uena Kelatte &ndash; Sheen Gu La Li Bal!"</i></p>
        <p>^ The entirety of Oracle-Levianism as a Philosophy/Belief-system/Vibe explained and uttered in one sentence.</p>
