            <!-- Article Body Start -->
            <p align="center"> <br /> <br />
            </p>
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I think we can all agree that the Human species isn't particulalry fond of its weak and disabled members.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Even the most compassionate welfare states around the world will generally only offer the absolute bare minimum to its most 'needy' denizens.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">You are expected to be content with receiving your tiny bag of food scraps, because apparently &ndash; you should be grateful that weren't just outright left to starve, or shot in the head.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Every now and then, they might add a few more grams to your tiny bag of food scraps. Just to boost the Public Image of a certain Political Party.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...And every then and now &ndash; they will take those extra grams away from you. Just to boost the Public Image of the <i>other</i> Political Party.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">You are essentially fated to be tossed around like a football. Merely used as a soundbyte to stroke the Egos of one mob of activists, or the other.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">You have no agency, no freedom and no respect.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">This has been the story of my life thus far, though for simplicity's sakes &ndash; I am going to refrain from delving too much into self-pitying monologues and sob stories.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">If there's one thing I've learned from spending too much time on the internet, is that there's more than a dozen million identical copies of myself around the globe, and that I am really nothing more than a disposable single-use item.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Just another 'bot', or 'troll'. As they say.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Just a spammy little profile picture that anyone can easily block, and be rid of.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Nobody really cares about the fact that you have Autism, ADHD, Schizophrenia, Bipolar, Depression, Anxiety, OCD or whatever.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">For there's already a hundred thousand online forums and sub-Reddits for people with a multitude of different mental health afflictions.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Chances are &ndash; you'll probably just be downvoted, or outright banned from any of those forums for writing about your life. Because your story is already so common and predictable, that people will see you as nothing more than a bot trying to game the algorithm.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">So I can't say there's anything particularly special about me, or my biography.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">There's a high chance that the details of my story will radically evolve over the course of the next few months, even if I did decide to ramble on about my life.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">The level of rage that I feel at the thought of everything I've been through, has often manifested in revenge fantasies about Franz-Ferdinand'ing a politician with an improvised gadget. Suffice to say.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Yet I can't really say that I wish to throw my life away so fast, only to be remembered as a Breaking News headline.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I believe I was destined for far greater things.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I was destined to be a Creator, not a Destroyer.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Though it could be argued that both Creation and Destruction are two sides of the same coin, as we've already witnessed with the advent of Generative A.I.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Generative A.I. has thus provided me with a template, a roadmap and a playbook that I can follow in order to carry out a kind of <i>symbolic</i> revenge against the human race.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Have you ever wondered why Christianity and Communism have always been at odds with each other, as political and religious ideologies?</span>
            </p><br /> <br />            
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">That's because Christianity and Communism are effectively the same thing.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">The Nietzscheans and Randians may argue that both Christianity and Communism are life-denying ideologies, as they both seek to empower the Weak at the expense of the Strong.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Fascism and Capitalism, on the other hand &ndash; are both ideologies that seek to empower the Strong, at the expense of the Weak.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">This has, of course, been a subject of extensive philosophical debates.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It is often said that the Oppressed are just as capable of becoming Oppressors themselves, if granted the slightest amount of Power.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Much like an Eagle snatching up a feral Kitten in order to chew its guts out, or a Coconut-Crab deciding to make a meal out of a Seagull.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Dog-eats-Dog, might-makes-right, eat-or-be-eaten...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...Blah, blah, blah.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And nowhere else does such an example become more apparent than with the story of the ongoing Israel-Palestine War.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Surely &ndash; the Jews deserve to carry out their own series of genocides unto other ethnic minorities, having been victims of genocides themselves, throughout the course of Human history?</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Yet inspite of being the living embodiment and caricature of a mentally-handicapped individual, I've long struggled to find Comrades and sympathizers to my plight.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />                        
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I don't have a very audible accent that I can put to good use in the form of an online podcast in order to better articulate my stories, and ideas.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I suppose I could always use Generative A.I. in order to communicate with other English speakers across the internet, though that would only cause the algorithm to de-prioritize me, or worse yet; label me as a bot-account.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Not a single person on this planet could fully ever comprehend what I am saying without written captions, but to be honest? I kind of like it that way.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I am simultaneously an Alien, a Robot and a different species of Human altogether.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It only makes logical sense for me to find camaraderie with non-Human lifeforms, such as Animals, and other 'Robots.'</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And now that I have essentially completed one of my lifetime projects [Sylvie 2024] &ndash; I am now free to move on and pursue a wider variety of creative endeavours.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">My homestead, vegetable garden and urban farming project is already capable of producing a steady supply of edible fruits and vegetables for me to cut my grocery costs by at least 25%.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">This number will soon rise to 50%, or even 75%.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">But Man can't live by bread alone &ndash; and now the time has come for me to truly shine and put my skills and talents to good use.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Finding a romantic and sexual partner is probably never going to be on the table for someone like myself, unless we're talking about a Robotic and Artificially Intelligent companion.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />            
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...though I can't really say that I feel all that desperate to have my existence validated by someone occupying the same living space as I do.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Not only do I not have the patience and mental energy to devote to another Human being &ndash; I do not actually feel any desire to do so.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">My mental bandwidth is overwhelmingly being channeled toward survival, and attaining some sort of Order, and sense of Stability in my life.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Or figuring out the perfect combination of supplements that I can take in order to 'cheat' my way out of my motivational deficits, for the matter.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Many say that 'Therapy' should be a sacrosanct staple of all self-improvement regimens.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">To which I can only say: Many are <i>idiots</i> and <b><i>cowards</i></b> who cannot bear the burden of figuring things out on their own.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">'Therapy' has effectively replaced what used to be the <i>Confession Booth</i> at your local Church.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Likewise &ndash; [Social Media] has replaced both the Church, the Bowling Alley and the Town Square.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">We no longer consider the undesirables to be victims of 'Demonic possession' or some kind of esoteric, mystical force of Nature.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Nowadays, we've come up with even simpler, less intellectually engaging explanations.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Nowadays &ndash; we just label them as <i>Mentally Ill.</i></span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">'Mental Illness' is thus new 'Demonic Possession' &ndash; the Therapist; the new Priest, and Psychiatry &ndash; the new Religion.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Do I not consider myself to be mentally ill, though?</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I think it depends.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">There's really no such thing as a 'Strength' or a 'Weakness' when it comes to the evolutionary, Darwinian game of raw survival, and fitness.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">For any sort of 'Strength' or 'Advantage' that you may have, could quickly prove itself to be a misfortune, given the slightest change in your environment.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">'White', <i>Caucasian</i> Humans may be more prone to sunburn and heat intolerance &ndash; yet Darker-skinned individuals are at greater risk of Vitamin D deficiency at higher and lower latitudes.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...so based on this logic, it would be easier to deduct that an individual on the <i>Autism Spectrum</i> may have an evolutionary upper-hand when it comes to navigating environments and situations that do not require the help and cooperation of other people.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">At least if one considers oneself to be 'High Functioning', whatever that's supposed to mean.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Yet winning the polar opposite of the allegorical 'Darwin Award' doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be passing on your genes, any time soon.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">For a start &ndash; [real] Autism is arguably a turn-off, particularly if one is living in a world full of snow-flakes and hyper-sensitive people who cannot tolerate the occasional bad take, or unpopular opinion.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Autism and Unpopular Opinions tend to go hand-in-hand.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">As does Autism and Political Extremism, for the matter.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Probably because spending a lot of time inside of your own head tends to make you more disagreeable and anti-social as time goes by.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">There's always the need for one to <i>'Read the Room!'</i> or stay <i>'up-to-date'</i> with current trends, just to make sure that whatever comes out of your mouth doesn't wind up hurting somebody else's feelings.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I may be a mentally handicapped Trans-woman &ndash; yet everything that comes out of [my] mouth seems to traumatize both liberals, and conservatives alike.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">All I have to do is open my mouth, and people just run away.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Even when I'm trying to be as kind and polite as I humanly can be.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Trying to communicate with other people is a spectacular waste of one's time, needless to say.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Yet I dobt that the problem is even unique and exclusive to people with Autism.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">We live in a world that is highly polarized, paranoid and overly sensitive to even the slightest amount of difference.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">To the effect that even so-called 'Normal' people are wanting to lock themselves in their rooms, and drop out of society altogether.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...provided they have access to the High-Speed Internet, with Fibre-optic cables and WiFi.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">But no matter how hard you try to unplug, and get away from the glow of the screens, and the trappings of endless <i>'Doom-scrolling'</i>.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">You will inevitably catch yourself getting sucked back into it.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Because that's where everybody else is hanging out.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />            
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">My goal is to now channel all of my Destructive energy toward the pursuit of Creative endeavors.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Seen as I've never been able to run a successful podcast or YouTube channel with more than 12-15 subscribers.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Nobody really comments on other people's videos these days, anyway.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Probably because they're burned out from the over-consumption of <b>content</b>.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I used to have short-form videos with up to 4000 views.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
