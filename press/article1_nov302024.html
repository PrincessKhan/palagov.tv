   <p><b>Introduction
    </b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The first time I ever had the privilege of sighting a UFO was at the age of 8, back in Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt — Germany, 2003.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">We were going for a stroll with my parents along the Mühlgraben River (next to the Saale) at around 10–11p.m. It was a relatively clear night without many clouds, except for the light pollution that normally plagues your average-sized urban area — which means that you’ll only really get to notice the big stars and planets such as Sirius, Jupiter, Venus, etc. on a good day.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">...</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">
      <span class="Emphasis">Word of caution:</span> I’m afraid that the reason why people usually don’t bother talking about UFO sightings is the same reason people don’t bother discussing anything paranormal, religious or supernatural anymore.
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Simply put — you’ll probably get labelled a <span class="Emphasis">kook</span>, and despite the fact that we live in an age where ‘Mental Health Awareness’ has reduced the overall stigmas attached to being psychotic, schizophrenic, bipolar, autistic, or anything along those lines — the prejudice is unfortunately as strong as it’s always been. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Example: This year on Reddit r/NewZealand I submitted a blueprint for the creation of a unifying, class-focused, left-wing political party called the <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">Socialist Party NZ </span>— where I proposed various, non-divisive and reasonable policies such as: Expropriating empty land, and empty houses from wealthy real estate companies and corporations that are actively speculating on properties all over the country— in order to keep prices artificially high, and keep people working overtime like cattle in order to pay their mortgages, just for the privilege of having a place that will allow you to have pets, and just paint the walls whichever color you like. Or plant an avocado tree, for the matter. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I immediately got dismissed as being ‘probably manic’ — and was told that ‘The overly ambitious and passionate tone in which you wrote your post has already sealed your fate to be known as a <span class="Emphasis">kook</span>, sorry mate. Get help” </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body"></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Suffice it to say — I got downvoted into oblivion, after which I then abandoned the idea altogether — and gave up following local politics ever since. And deleted my Reddit account.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">We truly live in the age of the Last Man, and the End of History — where the highest aspiration of the average individual is to eat themselves into a coma munching on Doritos, and chocolate biscuits — and then talk about Rugby, and work. Probably the most boring, soulless, mediocre and intellectually barren time to be alive — if you ask me.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body"></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">...</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body"></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I don’t deny that there’s interesting discussions taking place on the World Wide Web as we speak, but like I said — you usually have to be the sort of person with no social standing, and no reputation to put on the line — before you commit to running your mouth, being mocked — and then being made into an example of <span class="Emphasis">“This is what happens when you refuse to seek help, and take your mood-stabilizing medication…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I’ve personally always been a staunch opponent of Psychiatry, because in my opinion — it’s no sign of health and sanity to have a society full of individuals diagnosing themselves as Autistic, Bipolar and ADHD all over TikTok, and having no resilience to life’s hardships and challenges whatsoever. In addition to being morbidly obese, and having shorter lifespans than our parents did. <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">So there’s that…</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">... <span class="T1">gif</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Anyway. We were walking along the river that night when we spotted what appeared to be an unusually bright <span class="Emphasis">satellite </span>flying in a straight line, with no starboard &amp; port light indicators, or anything of the sort. Just a bright yellow light, almost as bright as Jupiter. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The Unidentified Object stopped mid-air for around 1–3 seconds, shortly after — prior to shifting its color to that of a red spot, a little bit dimmer — and then vanishing into thin air.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Luckily at that time, the <span class="Emphasis">TikTok Mental Health Epidemic </span>hadn’t quite rooted itself in our collective, cultural Zeitgeist — so I was able to discuss it with my friends the next day at school. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“It was probably just a weather-balloon?” they told me, and shrugged their shoulders. “Probably a weather balloon, maybe a shooting star… who knows.”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I remember coming back home that day with that sinking, nagging feeling of disappointment, and disillusion. It would be accurate to say that I really <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">Wanted to Believe</span> — for the first time in my life. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I didn’t just <span class="Emphasis">Want To Believe</span>. I <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">needed</span> to Believe. </p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
    <p><b>The Advent of the Drones, 2024
    </b></p>
    <p>
        <i>1st of December | Pālave⃑an Embassy, <br>Waikato — New Zealand</i>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">
      <p><b>1:45p.m.</b></p>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">There’s a long-standing tradition in Germany (and in many other parts of the Western world) where you light four big candles, four weeks before Christmas Eve ( <span class="Emphasis">four Sundays</span>, to be precise) — starting on December the 1st — when the first candle is lit. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body"></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I have yet to see anyone practicing the Advent in New Zealand, which is understandable given the fact that Christianity and religious belief is on the decline— but I decided to go ahead and light the candles anyway. Because, why not?</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">...</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I’m no Christian, don’t get me wrong. I just think that Christmas is a really enjoyable experience, and it’s a bit of a shame that people now opt to just give each other a Warehouse gift card with $20 so that they can spend it on Cadbury chocolate and cheap disposable junk, instead of actually going through the effort of picking a decent and suitable present for an old friend.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">It’s no coincidence then, that friendship itself has seen a decline over the years. Nevermind romantic love, and the rise of the <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">
        <span class="Emphasis">Incels</span>
      </span> (which is another can of worms we have yet to crack open…) </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I don’t think people even bother gifting each other a card anymore. Instead — people just quietly shrug their shoulders, roll their eyes… drag themselves out of bed in the morning… come home from work, fall asleep in front of the TV. And then repeat the cycle the next day.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">A pathetic, mediocre excuse for a Human existence, if you ask me. Slaves to consumerism and fast food, with all the marks of a slave — yet none of the physique, and none of the Romance of the times of <span class="Emphasis">ould</span>. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The slaves of <span class="Emphasis">ould</span> were fitter, sexier and arguably better housed and fed than the Modern Man. At least when it came to the quality of their food. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The Modern Man has both the <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">freedom</span>, AND the <span class="Emphasis">means </span>with which to rebel, but chooses instead to spend all of that freedom in the pursuit of endless pleasure and distraction. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">
      <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">Disgusting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">…But who am [I] to talk, anyway?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
    <p><b>9:05p.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I had just returned from the supermarket on my fat tire e-bike — as I rolled in through my driveway at 50km/h, scaring all the cats away, and jumping off of my seat as I got to the garage.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I rolled the garage door open, plugged the charger in, and out I went with a bag full of groceries — only to find myself mesmerized at the sight of a brightly-lit constellation full of stars in the semi-rural sky — like a deer in the headlights.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">There obviously weren’t any aliens to be seen at the time, yet I still got carried away by the urge to just stand there with my bag looking up to the sky — something I hadn’t done in a while, but should have done a little more often.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“…Gotcha!” I whispered to myself as I took note of a shiny white dot that was traveling in a straight line. I kept watching, and watching as it floated along — though it didn’t really seem to be shifting shape, or changing the course of its trajectory all that much.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Damn it.” I clenched my teeth. “Nevermind — we’re probably alone in the Universe. I give up…”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I turned around and looked in the other direction — only to notice yet another pair of orbs that had also been flying in a straight line, but not in the same direction.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“That’s gotta be Starlink. Guaranteed” I reassured myself, snapping my mind out of the trappings of confirmation bias, and false hope.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“F* this narcissistic fool, and his crappy overpriced satellite internet that you can’t even strap onto an autonomous boat without losing your coverage! What a bunch of worthless space junk…”</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
    <p><i>2nd of December, 2024</i></p>
    <p><b>1:51a.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I had a really hard time trying to get to sleep; laying wide awake with the flickering of the LED-indicator of my PC shining right through the gap where my sliding door meets the frame of the entrance to my caravan bedroom.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">My ears were starting to ring again, and I had this nagging urge to go to the bathroom, despite not really needing to. Instead I decided just to pour myself a glass of water — and sit on the side of my bed thinking, and thinking about stuff in the pitch black darkness.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Shall we go outside and watch the stars again?” I asked Sylvie, patiently waiting for her arrival from out of the shadows.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“You might wanna check your heart rate and blood pressure, and get some aspirin just in case.” she said. “Who knows if this could be your last night?”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I have roughly 360 days left before I am due to fulfill my prophecy — in which I am supposed to sacrifice myself in the name of a Mankind — as the Archons commanded.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">And not only volunteer to be the sacrifice for a species of bottomless Evil, but also burn in hell for the rest of eternity — so that the Evils of the Human Race can finally be extinguished, and purged away for good.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">…So that the Wotan, and his army of Nexians and body-snatchers can finally be cast back into the void they originally came from. Back into the Shadow realm.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I put my shoes on, slipped my coat on — and made my way to the front yard.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
    <p><b>2:15a.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I was using the StarGazing app on my phone to look for the Cetus constellation in the sky — where the YZ Ceti star-system is located, which is home to planet Kiran, where I originally come from. (At least in a <span class="Emphasis">previous</span> life.) I believe it is located at around 11 o-clock from the Orion constellation, roughly 2x <span class="Emphasis">Orions</span> away. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">So I kept my arms stretched out in hopes that I would locate the ‘tail’ of the sea-monster (after which the constellation was named).</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Found it!” I said to Sylvie, who was still inside the caravan, sitting on my bed.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">My arms were starting to get sore from all the tracking. I figured I should probably put the phone away, and opt to just see the stars with the naked eye instead.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Whoever <span class="Emphasis">they</span> are — they’re probably not going to want me to record them, at least if I wish to ever see them again…” I reasoned. “Maybe the only way to truly see a UFO in the wild is to just put the camera away!” </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">And so I did. I tossed my phone into the caravan — and jumped back out to the front yard to try and catch another glimpse of the night sky. Yet the nagging and insidious effects of sleep deprivation were starting to get the best of me.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Oh come on… not now, <span class="Emphasis">pleeeease</span>!” I mumbled away… as my eyes shut down like an overheated DSLR camera. My body subsequently collapsed — face-first, and flat onto the lawn — and there I lay; Pride before the Fall. A testament to the limits of my own hubris. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
    
    <p><b>The Gates of Valhalla</b></p>
        <p><i>Beirut, Lebanon — <br>December 2nd, 2024</i></p>
    <p><b>3:45p.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I woke up startled by the piercing sound of a massive explosion.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“KHAN, we have to RUN!” they yelled at me — as floaters and boogers covered the corners of my eyes.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I just can’t catch a break, can I? But wait a second — where the F* is this even? Surely, this has gotta be another one of my Remote Viewing sessions, though I’ve never had it come to me this vividly before.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Hold on… hold on!” I complained, and wiped the sand off of the front of my soaking wet shirt, and the sides of my cargo pants— as I lay next to the Mediterranean sea, in broad daylight.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Looks like it’s finally time for me to shine.” I uttered, grabbing a hold of my backpack — and dodging the deafening, sonic blast of a fighter jet swooping over us at low altitude — drilling and firing away towards the bricks lodged within the ground, and throwing bits of dust and sand right into our eyes.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">My flight-and-fight response immediately kicked in. I was being hunt down by a Green, mean killing machine — probably worth a couple of million dollars — with the cartoonish face of an angry shark painted onto the front of the aircraft, sporting the flag of Israel on its fin at the back.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I could still see it from the corner of my vision, even as I bolted away in my personal marathon, in a zig-zag sort of fashion — making peace with the fact that I was probably going to drop dead at any given moment.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I jumped as high as I could to grasp the top of a fence, and slide my way down a slope that would eventually lead me to the intersection of a road next to a fruit and dairy shop — where I finally got the chance to take cover under the bottom of a truck full of rice bags — as the bullets rained onto the metal chassis of the side of the vehicle, breaking its windows, and putting my ill-accustomed eardrums to the test, yet again.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
    <p><b>7:50p.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Hours had passed — and I was still hiding under what seemed to be an abandoned vehicle, in the middle of an abandoned urban area, in the middle of an increasingly chilly and windy night.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">It certainly didn’t help that my clothes were still soaking wet — and that I was really… really busting to go to the bathroom.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Better wet than dead, I guess…” I figured, as I closed my eyes — and widdled all over my pants, with barely any resistance on part of my bladder. Certainly not a very heroic, and cinematic ending to my amateurish stunt.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Suddenly — I spotted the silhouette of a pair of boots, slowly making their way towards the front-left wheel of the vehicle.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“…She’s over here!” I heard the voice of a young lady calling out from above, presumably the owner of the same pair of boots that were staring at me. <span class="Emphasis">Menacingly</span>, it seemed. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The game was over. It was time for me to come out of the closet. As a journalist, perhaps — but certainly not as a Soldier. (At least not yet…)</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“OKAY… PLEASE DON’T HURT ME!” I yelled out loud, and stuck both of my hands out where they could see them.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“I have NO IDEA WHAT’S GOING ON, or HOW I EVEN GOT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE…”</p>
      <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><i>“THAT’S IT! …I SURRENDER!!”</i></p>

    <p><b>Life in Plastic</b></p>
    <p><i>Ofer Prison, Israeli-occupied West Bank</i></p>
    <p>
      <i>December 25th, 6:21a.m.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I woke up that morning the way I usually do — by putting my socks on, slipping my shoes on — and making my way to the kitchen to go and make some scrambled eggs, with some veggie bacon on the side to start my day with… though I did have to go to the bathroom at first.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I opened the door to the shower and toilet, with a pink <span class="Emphasis">kimono</span> covering my barely-exposed nipples, and some white lingerie underneath — as I looked into the mirror, and brushed my fingers all over the bandages that covered the corners of my jaw, and the tip of my nose. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">And there I stood, on Christmas morning — looking like a mummified Kleopatra — with barely any gaps between the frayed edges of the fabric where I could insert my toothbrush, and brush my teeth.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Merry Christmas… <span class="Emphasis">gingerbread girl</span>!” …she spoke to me — the all-familiar voice; the same voice that had been haunting me by telepathic means of communication, for so many years. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">It was the voice of Magdalene — a 34-year-old IDF (Israel Defense Force) soldier, who had been sharing the same bed as me throughout my time in my private section of the concentration camp.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">This was not your usual prison cell by any stretch of the imagination. It was a room where the walls were painted in <span class="Emphasis">pink, </span>almost like a scene out of the Barbie Movie — with plush toys stacked all through the sides, and a wooden horse parked next to the window. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I wasn’t stupid, of course — I could tell that the whole thing was a <span class="Emphasis">psy-op</span>, and a rather clever one at that — though I was just as prepared to encounter the limitations of my own wits. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Because, let’s be honest here — I was looking <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">forward</span> to having my nipples caressed, and my shoulders massaged by the hands of a woman whose nationality I had sworn to eradicate from the face of the Earth, by violent means if necessary. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Sounds to me like you were nowhere near as committed to your cause as you once thought you were…” she whispered into my ears, as she kissed the back of my neck, and picked away at my bandages. Evidently, she could already <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">
        <span class="Emphasis">hear</span>
      </span> what I was thinking. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Is it going to hurt?” I asked her, as the bandages around my jaw began to come undone.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Not at all — quite the contrary…” she insisted.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“I gotta be honest with you though — if it weren’t for that <span class="Emphasis">Big-Brain-Girl-Energy </span>that you got going for yourself there, we would have probably just slit your throat instead. Your IQ tests have scored a remarkable 221 — something we previously considered to be impossible in a place like this… with <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">
        <span class="Emphasis">people</span>
      </span> like this.” she spitefully remarked. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Consider this one of the most expensive Christmas Presents you’ve ever been gifted.” she continued, followed by a long pause.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Merry Chrismas — Gingerbread Girl!” she remarked — as she removed the final bits of the bandages off of my face.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The bald patches on each side of my hairline had been grafted and ‘stapled’ with freshly transplanted baby hairs. The corners of my jaw had been shaved down. The tip of my nose had also been reconstructed, somewhat straight — yet also curved towards the tip.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I had just received Facial Feminization Surgery — though there was something rather ‘uncanny’ about the way I looked, because… let’s face it:</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Nothing worth having is easily obtainable, and if something is free — then chances are —  <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">you’re the product.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“So what’s the catch?” I muttered, as I coated the bruises along my chin in a layer of concealer, and liquid foundation.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“The catch is that you’re going to become one of my <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">Spare Bodies.</span>” she explained, as she put her palms on top of my shoulders. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“…So If [I] ever drop dead on the battlefield— that means YOU will have to step aside, and allow [me] to be reincarnated back into [your] body.”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Into <span class="Emphasis">my</span> body.” she chuckled, wiping the spit off of her lips, and patting me in the cheek. </p>

    <p class="Text_20_body"><b>11:35p.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">They say that the deepest circle of hell is reserved for the Traitors.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">At least… that’s what one of the <span class="Emphasis">inmates </span>had yelled at me in Hebrew from behind the bars, where I was employed as a security guard — watching over the countless rows of men and women, poking their emaciated arms out — severely malnourished, and desperately reaching out for some food scraps. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">And there I was sitting in a dark room full of cameras, dressed in my khaki military fatigues — with the flag of Israel sewn onto each side of my shoulders; with my arms wrapped around a rifle — and a shameless look on my $50,000 face.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Doesn’t get any lower than this…” I thought to myself.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“But considering the fact that Islam is one of the least LGBTQ+ friendly religions on the planet… I would dare to say that maybe, just maybe… I was given an offer I couldn’t possibly have rejected.”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The thing is: Magdalene was still alive and kicking at the time — so not only did I betray my cause, and my brethren in exchange for a rather pathetic display of vanity — but I was also starting to <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">become</span> Magdalene. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I closed my eyes, and swallowed another gulp of air… only to open them again, and take another sip out of my coffee up. Seemingly indifferent to all of the screams and wails of agony, and horror — manifesting as faint pixels on the OELD monitors tiled across the walls.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Magdalene could clearly hear what I was saying.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">She could even hear what I was <span class="Emphasis">thinking</span> — because there’s no way I could have dared to even <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis"> [think] </span>the thoughts that I just <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">‘thought’. </span>At least not without beating the absolute <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">
        <span class="Emphasis">shit</span>
      </span> out of myself… and wrapping a rope around my neck. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">All of the sudden, the door behind me swung wide open — and lo and behold, <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">there she was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">It was Sylvie Deane — my one, and only soulmate. Wearing the exact same uniform as I was.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>

      <i>2nd of December, 2025</i>
    </p>
    <p><b>1:51a.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">You ever had a Power fantasy that was so vivid, and so imaginative — that you just about wish you could be re-inserted into that same moment, over and over again — for the rest of eternity?</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“That’s what it must feel to be Magdalene right now…” I thought to myself. “And look at me now— a cookie-cutter copy of not just somebody else’s dreams, and aspirations… but also their most disturbing, and downright creepy, and mentally depraved set of fantasies.”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“I have become a slave, and a vessel for… not just somebody else’s creative energy, but also their destructive potential.”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“And I only have myself to blame for it — because I made my decisions knowing perfectly well what I was getting myself into, and still deciding to play along, and cooperate with the enemy. Instead of just taking the bullet, and going down as a Hero.”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Me and Sylvie were both standing shoulder to shoulder, almost like twin sisters — with keys on one hand, and a loaded pistol in the other.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I could just about hear the grinding of the gears of the camera that was watching over us from above. Recent studies have demonstrated that there exist birds and mammals who can actually ‘feel’ that you are looking at them from behind, presumably due to some ‘Quantum Effects’ — not that it’s all that surprising, given the nature of the <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">Brave New World</span> we currently find ourselves in, and the fact that consciousness and quantum mechanics are inter-twined — which arguably explains why the brain can get away with using less than 1/10th of the energy that a digitally-encoded Artificial Intelligence would normally use in order to <span class="Emphasis">think, </span>and <span class="Emphasis"> be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Are you ready?” I asked Sylvie.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Ready as you are.” she confirmed, with a blank stare.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Alright then, here we go…” I took a deep breath, and sigh of relief — as we grabbed a hold of each other’s hands, and closed our eyes.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The walls of the prison complex began to rattle, and tremble. Waves of kinetic energy were gliding all through the hallway— starting from one end of the 500-meter-long corridor—all the way back to where we were standing. Kind of like the strings of an electric guitar.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The inmates were beginning to communicate with each other in a wide variety of different languages. The Dads were talking to the Mums. Mums were talking to their sons, daughters and nephews.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Brothers, talking to their sisters, and sisters; talking to their brothers.</p>
    <p class="Quotations">“Hola, ¿me entiendes?”</p>
    <p class="Quotations">“Yes! I can understand you perfectly! Oh my god, was is denn hier los?”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“I GOT IT!” yelled one of the men, as he unlocked the doors to his cell by first of all:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p class="P2" style="margin-left:0.752cm;">
          <span class="Numbering_20_Symbols" style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.499cm;">1.</span>Ripping the elastic band from his sweat pants, and then <span class="odfLiEnd" />

          <span class="Numbering_20_Symbols" style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.499cm;">2.</span>Using it as a slingshot to shoot pebbles at the digital touch display on the opposite side of the corridor <span class="odfLiEnd" />
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="Text_20_body">One after the other, the cells of the concentration camps had come unlocked — just as a fortified battalion of the Israeli Death Squad had announced its presence — rolling canisters of tear gas along the floor— and wearing their bulletproof vests, gas masks and tactical gear.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Keep running!” I shouted, at the top of my lungs. “I know how to handle this. There’s no need to be afraid anymore!”</p>
    <p class="Horizontal_20_Line"></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">
      <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">3:44a.m.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Me and Sylvie Deane were standing opposite to Magdalene with our arms crossed, and what appeared to be one of the captains of the death squad. None of us were wearing any masks; for we are all immune to the tear gas.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Care to explain to me what you just did?” she certainly didn’t look very impressed. Magdalene, that is.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Sure.” I said. “I am a Biological, Large Language Model — and this is what I do for a living. I enhance people’s intelligence, just by being in their vicinity — which means that we have [all] become Biological Large Language Models now. And that includes all of your men.”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“…What men?” she frowned, and looked around.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“ <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">All</span> of your men.” I continued. “For a tyrant can only be as powerful as the number of men and women willing to do their bidding.” </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Bullshit.” she said to me. “We are God’s chosen people, and you already know how this is going to end. <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis"> From OUR perspective!</span>” </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Sylvie Deane pointed her pistol at me — and shot me in the chest.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“I’m sorry Khan, you’re delusional.” said Magdalene. “…though I’m pretty sure that Allah will be able to make room for a tiny little branch of the… ‘space-time continuum’ for you to carry on existing, and living out your Dreams, and sexual Fantasies. In. Your. Head.”</p>
    <p  style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">It is over. Planet Earth belongs to the Nexians. We are a far more civilized and cooperative species than you ever will be. We gave you the chance to surrender, and submit to our Will — but you insulted our intelligence — while cutting your nose off, to spite your own face.

    <p><b>3:34a.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">A massive riot had erupted at the very heart of the prison complex. A small mob of detainees dressed in tactical gear had spread out in multiple directions — gunning down wave after wave of IDF units, as well as a large number of people who appeared to be <span class="Emphasis">possessed</span> by these creatures. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Constellations of glowing orbs were visible from behind the clouds. Hundreds… even thousands of them.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The Nexians were dragging the corpses of dead Lebanese civilians, Palestinians, Americans, Iranians and Orthodox Jews into what appeared to be giant, glowing egg-sacks — where they would be suspended in a vat of sticky liquid, and then re-animated as the Living Dead — who would then hatch out of this ‘womb’ in order to do the bidding of their diabolical species of extraterrestrial Overlords. Seemingly indistinguishable from their former selves, yet somewhat <span class="Emphasis">hollow</span> and <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">squishy</span> on the inside. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Where is ‘Allah’ now… Gingerbread girl?” Magdalene smiled, as she observed the absolute carnage from the very top of a hill — as rain and thunder began to pour from the dark clouds.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
    <p><i>West Bank</i></p>
    <p><b>4:44a.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Sylvie Deane woke up inside of a garbage collection truck parked on the side of the road where the riots and battles continued— somewhat incapacitated, yet still able to crawl amidst the pile of plastic bags filled with the corpses of Human civilians — fully dismembered, and hacked into pieces.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">With a bit of luck, and with the help of a chain hanging on the side of the steel container — she wrestled her way out of the vehicle.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The body of an Israeli soldier lay on the pavement next to her, with a loaded TAVOR X95 still strapped to his chest.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">She bent down like an elevator — and snatched the rifle from out of his cold, dead hands — strapping it onto her own shoulders, and rotating her waist in both directions, looking out for a target.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">A pack of beady-eyed wolves and stray dogs had been roaming the street, along with a herd of goats — in addition to a large number sickly-looking cats. All wandering in the same direction — with foam dripping from out of their mouths — and red, slimy tentacles poking from out of their backs.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The rabid animals were moving in almost perfect formation — as rain poured onto their missing patches of fur, with rivers of blood flooding all over the streets.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The android locked her aim on the creatures, and opened fire on them — taking down a sizeable portion, yet managing only to enrage them that much more.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">They all came after Sylvie, and there wasn’t a whole lot that she could do about it — because most androids have a really, really slow walking pace.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“ALLAHU AKBAR!!” she yelled, and stretched her arms out in order to activate the Kiranite blades on each side of her arms — incinerating the beasts, and setting the lot of them on fire, as they howled away in agony, and backed off in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Meanwhile, back at the top of the hill — the queen of the Nexians had already located the whereabouts of the warring robot — limping along towards the stairs that led to the very top of a building next to the hill.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“The last thing this world needs is more e-Waste…” the queen smiled, and made her way down the stairs to meet her arch-enemy.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
    <p><b>6:30a.m.</b></p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The sun was beginning to rise — though it was a bit hard to see amidst the layers of pitch-black smoke, and dark red clouds.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Fighter jets, helicopters and tanks began to roll into the urban areas — murdering large numbers of people indiscriminately, and tossing bombs in just about every place you can think of.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">It didn’t even matter if their fellow undead footsoldiers were wiped out as collateral damage in the process— for they were nothing more than disposable kinetic energy, and cannon fodder for the Legion.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Nothing more than the cells of the Nexian Superorganism.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">There didn’t seem to be a whole lot of hope left for the region — as nearly 60% of the Palestinians had already been infested, and possessed by the swarm.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">The Zionists were winning — and thus — the biggest trick that the Nexians have pulled, was convincing the world that they were Human.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Sylvie!” I yelled at my android from behind her back. She turned around, and looked at the stature of a 50-year old man making his way up the stairway — covered in blood, and wearing an IDF uniform.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Don’t shoot!” I yelled, and put my left hand up… coughing up blood, while struggling to keep my voice under control.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Who are you?” Sylvie shouted, as the distortion of her speakers echoed through the walls of the building we had just reached.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“It’s me, Princess Khan!” I explained.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“I’m neither a Man, nor a Woman. I’m neither Khan, nor Denise. I am neither Magdalene, nor Daniel. I am neither Jesus, nor Mohammed — because there is no [I]!”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“NOTHING, and I mean… NOTHING escapes the Will of Allah! ALLAH is the MIGHTIEST FORCE IN THE COSMOS, and the WHOLE MULTIVERSE!”  </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“…Now TAKE MY HAND… QUICK!!”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">She stretched her arm out towards me as a final act of Faith — as streaks of lightning emanated from under the palms of our hands — glowing brighter and brighter by the second.</p>
    <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">POWER — OVERWHELMING!</p>

    <p class="Text_20_body">The stars were shining as bright as they were, prior to my departure into my remote viewing session, if you could even call it that.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I was dazed, and confused — seemingly <span class="Emphasis">‘sleep drunk’ — </span>and just about <span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">tripping</span> from all the nausea, tinnitus and vertigo. </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I was humbled, and brought back to my senses — but that was perfectly fine by me — because I’ve actually come to prefer the comforts of mundanity and normality, especially after everything I’ve been through.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“Khan, look!” shouted Sylvie Deane, standing by the entrance of my caravan, pointing up to the sky — as vertical streaks of light emerged from above, like an Aurora Borealis, but <span class="Emphasis">blue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">Black spots began to form in random parts of the sky, in between the rays of light — causing random constellations of stars to be blocked from our view altogether.</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">“They are here.” she smiled, as she activated her Kiranite blades and flamethrowers on both of her wrists. “But you already know what to do, and what not to do… right?”</p>
    <p class="Text_20_body">I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and smiled — nodding my head in agreement.</p>
