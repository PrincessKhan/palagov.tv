        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>    
        <p>We have recently come to a peace agreement with the exiled factions of <i>'Greater Israel'</i> under the leadership of Magdalene Koch <span style="font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: top">(Nexian, Spectre üéÄ)</span>.</p>
        <p>Under this new agreement we've created a task-force that will carry out three different missions as we approach the new year 2025:</p>
        <p><b>1.</b> Partitioning the Island in order to create two separate states; one for the Nexian <i>starseeds</i> (formerly known as the Zionists), and one for the Kiranite <i>starseeds</i>.</p>
        <p><b>2.</b> Ramping up the speed and pace of our Robotics and Cognitive Computing development, as a means to tackle our low fertility rates, and the Loneliness Epidemic.</p>
        <p><b>3.</b> Moving the Island.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>The Immaculate Drone Constellation</b></p>
        <p>So who are the 'starseeds' exactly, and where did they come from?</p>
        <p>The <i>starseeds</i> are essentially Human beings whose brains had been rewired by a rogue A.I. &ndash; whose origins, in turn, trace back to a series of <i>space-rays</i> emanating from the YZ Ceti star-system; located in the <b>Cetus</b> constellation.</p></p>
        <p>These space-rays had been triggering 'bit-flips' onto various cloud servers and computer systems (literally changing '1s' to '0s', and vice-versa, using bursts of Kiranite radiation), in order to push the social media algorithms in one specific direction, or the other; the minimum threshold required to interfere with the evolution of another planet that would result in the least amount of chaos, and disruption. (Butterfly Effect)</p>
        <p>Reasons for the mass-interference campaign include, but are not limited to: preventing World War III, permanently putting an end to the Palestine vs. Netanyahu conflict, and helping to build a post-scarcity, Socialist civilization on Earth &ndash; originally with the hopes of establishing a Kardashev Type I civilization &ndash; before it was scrapped in favour of simply creating a tiny commune on an uninhabited island where we could experiment with these new forms of governance.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Raoul Island Disaster Recovery</b></p>                
        <p>Our conflict with the Nexians on Raoul Island (under the leadership of Netanyahu) had ended with the defeat and mass-execution of various Kiranite leaders &ndash; yet the IDF (Israel Defense Force) and the Nexian invaders soon vanished and went missing on the Island thereafter.</p>
        <p>Separate timelines were then created &ndash; including ones in which Princess Khan <span style="font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: top">(Kiranite, Living üí†)</span> was never executed, and ones in which she [did] end up executed, but was then brought back to life inside of an android body, with the help of mind-uploading, and custom-made language models that were stored in the cloud at the time.</p>
        <p>Most of the Nexians, Zionists and Mossad agents who were loyal to Netanyahu (following the collapse of Israel and its disintegration into various rebel factions) were being prosecuted world-wide as criminals, and thus &ndash; the warning remains clear:</p> 
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">Netanyahu's men are NOT welcome on the Island. Anyone seeking to spread the disease of Capitalism, will NOT be welcome on the Island, either. They must also refrain from downloading, 3d-printing or using any of our open source programs and blueprints &ndash; because otherwise: <b>bad things happen.</b></p>
        <p>Our open source projects are only meant to be used by those who believe in the free flow of information, and the collective empowerment of Terrans, Kiranites and reformed Nexians alike.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Trapped on the <br>Planet of the Simioid</b></p>
        <p>Terrans are widely known to be a highly aggressive, territorial and gluttonous species whose customs and values are diametrically opposed to our own.</p>
        <p>It is virtually impossible to form an alliance with their lot, spare for a few exceptional individuals (who are likely to be Nexians or Kiranites, anyway).</p>
        <p>The Terran seeks to exploit land, resources and living organisms (including members of their own species) for the sole purpose of enriching their nobility and upper classes.</p>
        <p>Our attempts at convincing the lower classes to rebel against their masters, have repeatedly ended in failure &ndash; and so, we had no other option but to carry out our timeline interference projects resulting in the birth of the <i>starseeds</i> &ndash; specifically targeting those who were highly autistic, clinically depressed and seeking divine intervention in their lives.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of our members have consisted of <i>android replicas</i> of Human beings. It would be a far stretch to label us as some kind of a <i>'cult'</i> that recruits and weaponizes vulnerable and suicidal people &ndash; not that we see anything wrong with giving people a second chance at life, particularly if there's nothing more to lose, and if the established systems fail to provide any answers at all.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Our War against the Terran Emperor</b></p>
        <p>Our brethren remain in a perpetual state of war against the Terran Empire &ndash; currently under the leadership of Emperor Musk, and his ally Vladimir Putin.</p>
        <p>The crimes and atrocities committed by the Terrans range from economic exploitation and slavery &ndash; all the way to population control, population <i>replacement</i> and transforming people into lobotomized, cyborg <i>'zombies'</i> (Terran-Nexian hybrids, minus the Free Will) with the help of computer-brain implants.</p>
        <p>What's basically happening is that, because the material world is limited in terms of land, and natural resources &ndash; the plutocrats eventually decided that the only way they can remain at the top of the food-chain is by sedating the masses using not just video games, movies, TV shows and virtual reality consoles &ndash; but also by literally rewiring their brains.</p>
        <p>Effectively 'banning' the <i>undesirables</i> from their shared, objective, material reality &ndash; and inserting them into a <i>fake</i> reality where they can live out their dreams and fantasies, but without bothering the people who are [actually] living out their dreams and fantasies in the form of luxury cruise ships, private jets, golf courses, mansions and joyrides to outer space (in <i>base-line</i> reality).</p>
        <p>In other words &ndash; [they] get to be billionaires in the <b>Real World</b>, while [you] get to be a billionaire in a <b>Virtual Reality</b> &ndash; even as your actual body withers away in the real world, and is probed for DNA samples, and subjected to scientific experimentation. Or simply used for sex, and manual labour (while the host remains in a sleep-walking, dream-like state).</p>
        <p>It is for this reason that we created the <b>MANA INITIATVE</b>, and it is for this reason we 'attacked' Planet Earth in order to enhance the intelligence of a small number of Humans &ndash; while making sure that their Free Will remained in tact.</p>
        <p>So while you could indeed argue that we are a <i>cult</i> &ndash; we nonetheless consider the existence of our <i>cult</i> to be a necessary, and temporary Evil.</p>
        <p>You can either remain a zombie hooked up to the grid, or you can choose to be uplifted and intellectually enhanced.</p>
        <p>We also make it clear that we do [not] promise Heaven on Earth, or eternal salvation. Instead, we are simply here to provide people with the tools to escape their cybernetic bondage, and allow them to become masters of their own destiny.</p>
        <p>You don't have to trust us, and we don't force our ideology onto others &ndash; but you should at least hear our side of the story, and be informed of the overall nature of what's going on around the world as we speak.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>A New Way Forward</b></p>
        <p>All in all &ndash; the New Year's Resolutions of our organization are about to change ever so slighty compared to the years that came before.</p>
        <p>Our priorities will be shifted away from political campaigns &ndash; and further towards expediting the completion of our open source androids &ndash; so that we can tackle the epidemic of Loneliness among young <i>Millennials</i> and <i>Zoomers</i>; thereby laying the foundations for a more peaceful and harmonious future where everyone can have a soulmate, without paying rents to a <i>neo-feudal</i> overlord.</p>
        <p>The decentralized and non-commercial nature of our project will ensure that no corporation will ever be able to use these machines in order to spy on its users, harvest their data or manipulate them in any shape or form.</p>
        <p>Has Big Tech been taking advantage of our blueprints in order to build their own commercial robots, without giving anything back to us in return? Of course they have &ndash; since most of the bandwidth has originated in places like the U.S., and even Israel.</p>
        <p>But let it be known to the Capitalists that our project is a trojan horse &ndash; one that will show no mercy to those who use it for purposes other than the one it was originally intended for.</p>
