        <!--<p><b>Part 1</b></p>-->
    <p>I think we're probably already aware of the notion that lifting objects in the air through the interaction of brain-waves with matter, is in fact [impossible], at least from a physical standpoint - but this is merely the minuscule, Hollywood-themed box that we've chosen to trap ourselves in, leading us to a place of neverending frustration, and the lack of a proper roadmap through which we can attain personal growth and development, particularly when it comes to an area that no one else has yet succeeded in.</p>

    <p>Nothing worth having is easily obtainable, and if something like Telekinesis were [easy] for Human beings to perform, then somebody would have probably already beaten you to it - and the excitement and novelty of possessing such a Power would quickly fade out overnight.</p>

    <p>Compared to the rest of the animal kingdom, Human beings could already be considered to be a type of God: as in, an entity that is capable of not just bending the natural environment to their Will, but also capable of creating Life itself, or at least a close approximation of artificial life (i.e. robotics, A.I., nanotechnology, etc.)</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> <!-- Paragraph divider -->

    <p>Yet none of us walk around with any sort of swagger, or pride, at the thought of having a library with the world's knowledge stored in our pockets, and in many ways this Power will evoke a feeling of existential [dread] - almost as if you wished you could just throw the phone away, and start over. Or travel back in time to a simpler and more primitive era of Human history, which in my opinion is rather cowardly, and misguided.</p>

    <p>Indeed, nothing worth having is easily obtainable - and if everybody were a superhero, then quite frankly - nobody would be.</p>

    <p>Which means that, in order to achieve a skill that nobody else has yet achieved, we're going to have to tax our brains and bodies to the point where 99.9% of individuals will inevitably give in to the gravitational pull of sloth, and mediocrity.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> <!-- Paragraph divider -->

    <p>That's because anything that is mentally taxing to the brain comes with the risk of manifesting serious side effects (i.e. John Nash, Nikola Tesla, Friedrich Nietzsche, Howard Hughes, etc.) - so rather than trying to 'cut a deal with the devil' in search for a shortcut to greatness, one ought to instead push the limits of one's abilities more gradually - and come as close as you can to achieving your goal, without trying to go from 0 to a 100 all in one step.</p>

    <p>Because that's suffering ultimately means: When the Will encounters resistance.</p>

    <p>Yet where there is a will, there is usually a way to achieve something. Indeed, faster-than-light travel seems impossible, and violates the cosmic speed limit embedded in the laws of physics‚ÄîUNLESS you can warp the space-time around yourself.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> <!-- Paragraph divider -->

    <p>That [UNLESS] will be the key to unlocking our supernatural abilities, though I wouldn't necessarily call it 'unlocking', so much as it is [coming as close to levitating an object as you possibly can], and without the help of technology, or hidden magic tricks. Just you, your mind, and your bare hands.</p>

    <p>So how close to a feat like telekinesis could a human being possibly arrive?</p>

    <p>Enter the theory of Proto-Telekinesis:</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> <!-- Paragraph divider -->

    <p>1. The closer you get to a telekinetic feat, the more energy and calories you will burn, as reducing entropy always demands greater energy consumption.</p>

    <p>2. If you could kick a football into a basketball hoop with a 99% success rate, you‚Äôve already achieved proto-telekinesis. Martial arts and philosophies like Kung Fu, Karate, and Tai Chi all use this concept through the application of 'Chi,' which, in layman's terms, means concentrated, controlled, and focused energy.</p>

    <p>3. People like Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, and Jet Li could all be considered proto-telekinetic human beings, just as any master of ballet, Tai Chi, martial arts, or even chess and the game of Go would be.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> <!-- Paragraph divider -->

    <p>4. Proto-telekinetic animals would include: goats, flying fish, cheetahs, hummingbirds, and even domestic flies, fleas, among others.</p>

    <p>5. And thus, telekinesis would quite literally mean moving an object with such speed, that the hand becomes invisible -- or hurling a ball (or any object) at another target, consistently achieving a virtually flawless success rate. In this context, speed and reaction time, combined with the high consumption of mental and physical resources, are required to attain the lowest possible state of entropy (especially in the beginning when a neural network adjusts for its weights).</p>

    <p>In conclusion:</p>

    <p>Buy yourself a football, and start shooting basketball hoops.</p>
