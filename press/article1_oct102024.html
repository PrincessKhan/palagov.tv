        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>Before I introduce you to the Art, Discipline and Philosophy of Khanum Kineticism &ndash; it's worth pointing out that what we will be delving into is not an applied, <i>mainstream</i> 'Science' by any stretch of the imagination.</p>   
        <p>I have just about had a gutsful of Science, and the Scientific Method &ndash; in addition to dealing with its lifeless, dogmatic, boring, uncreative, skeptical and jaded practitioners and devotees.</p>
        <p>Not only are these people getting in the way of progress with their lack of curiosity and enthusiasm about existence, but they do unfortunately have strong Egos &ndash; so much so that they'd be willing to go out of their way to outright [sabotage] people who may hold different opinions, for fear that they may have to rethink their worldview altogether, and be proven Wrong.</p>
        <p>Those four-eyed weaklings, nerds and idiots are what I like to call 'Bugmen' &ndash; they're the Reddit Moderators, the Bill Gates'es, the Neil Degrasse Tysons as well as the World Economic Forum acolytes who control the world we live in, and prevent the discussion and exploration of new ideas, and perspectives &ndash; by labelling anything they don't like as 'Misinformation', and banning it on mainstream modes of communication.</p>
        <p>Mind you: I'm not saying that we should disregard the scientific method, or even ditch it altogether.</p>
        <p>What I instead propose is that we set aside a sort of 'sandbox' where we can test and explore new ideas, without having to clash with the scientific community, and be accused of peddling 'pseudoscience' or 'misinformation', because that's the only way that new ideas can come about, and have the opportunity to be 'tested' against reality.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.6em;">...</p>
        <p><b>Past and Future are <br>One and the Same; <br>It's All Connected</b></p>        
<p>Consciousness, and the Present &ndash; is just the Fork that grabs a hold of the Spaghettified Soup of the multitudinous Pasts, and Futures.</p>
<p>The Will is the strength and size of this fork. The stronger the Will, the greater the quality and density of the Life.</p>
<p>A goat that learns how to climb dams and mountains, without slipping, has the strongest Will of all -- the strongest capacity to experience Pain, and Pleasure. Just like the greatest of all Humans do.</p>
        <p>The minute you observe the Future &ndash; it immediately changes. Much in the same way that when you look out the window, and feel a bomb detonating &ndash; when it was in fact just a lightning strike, then so too, does the bomb instantly transform into a lightning strike. Through sheer virtue of Observation.</p>
