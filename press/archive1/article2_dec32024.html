<p><i>3rd of December, 2024 — <br>Raoul Island, Nexian-occupied Kermadec</i></p>
<p><a name="de19"></a><strong>6:34a.m.</strong></p>
<p><a name="8839"></a>“What’s the problem, <em>Gingerbread girl?”
</em><strong>the Fox</strong> had spoken, once again — as the IDF
security guards emerged from their tents in order to bring me a glass
of water.</p>
<p><a name="42de"></a>“I got my ass kicked.” I replied, and took
a sip out of the glass full of sour-tasting apple-crumble cider
which, in spite of its putrid taste, had a rather pleasant and
<em>‘perfume-like’</em> sort of smell, and aroma.</p>
<p><a name="ac11"></a>“Learned your lesson then, I assume?” she
placed her hands behind her back, and faced North towards the roaring
waves — as the sun began to rise in the East, with the high tide
creeping in.</p>
<p><a name="d775"></a>“I did.” I said to Magdalene, wiping my
lips off my sleeves. “The only thing that matters in this world is
Power, and Dominance. The strong thrive, the weak perish, and there
was nothing I could do about it anymore. That is the natural order of
things — and the Earth belongs to you now.”</p>
<p><a name="a472"></a>“Miss me with the pity party — you’re
pathetic. <strong>Now keep your mouth shut.</strong>” she uttered,
and then walked off towards her tent.</p>
<p><a name="a3c4"></a>“Prepare your nostrils.” she said. “We
will be inserting <strong>nematodes</strong> through your nose —
just to make sure that your Powers are fully extinguished, and that
you won’t be pulling off any tricks.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><a name="a137"></a><strong>7:44a.m.</strong></p>
<p><a name="cb30"></a>The Mossad had set up a portable clinic using a
shipping container, on the North Coast of Raoul Island — right next
to the research and monitoring facilities of the New Zealand Defense
Force (which may as well be the <em>Israel Defense Force — </em>because
they’re the exact same people, anyway.)</p>
<p><a name="512b"></a>For who could possibly be in charge of our
national security here in New Zealand, aside from the Americans, and
their Nexian puppet-masters — who purchased all of our land, and
cornered the real estate market in order to build mansions, golf
courses and underground bunkers for the multi-billion-dollar,
plutocratic <em>master race</em>, and nobility?</p>
<p><a name="b3d4"></a>“I promise this won’t hurt anymore than a
COVID-19 test-swab — so long as you remain still, take a deep
breath, and zip your <em>Schnauze</em>.” the Fox said to me, as she
gauged the dose on her 1ml plastic syringe — with a slimy, white
liquid pouring down the sides.</p>
<p><a name="6802"></a>I had been strapped to an operating bed inside
of the clinic, with a bright white set of LED lights shining onto my
face from above. Kind of like being at the dentist, but nowhere near
as exciting, and with much longer waiting times, I suppose.</p>
<p><a name="c430"></a>I was wearing a gown that had the phrase
<em>‘hospital property’</em> written all over it — which
reminded me of the time I was institutionalized as a result of severe
sleep deprivation and alcohol withdrawal. Perhaps it’s just a
flashback of the same moment, and the exact same event — playing in
my head all over again.</p>
<p><a name="4193"></a>The goldilocked nurse inserted the syringe into
my nose, and then gently flooded my nasal cavities with a genetically
modified variant of the <strong><em>Angiostrongylus cantonensis</em></strong><em>
</em>species — the same type of nematodes that are responsible for
the proliferation of the Rat Lungworm Disease in places like Hawaii,
as well as many parts of Southeast Asia, and even Australia.</p>
<p><a name="91f4"></a>The worms essentially burrow their way through
your brain, without necessarily ‘eating it’ — after which your
immune system kicks in; producing deadly symptoms of inflammation,
fever, as well as brutally painful headaches.</p>
<p><a name="7ad0"></a>The liquid inside of Magdalene’s syringe
would have probably been laced with a potent anti-inflammatory agent,
in order to preserve the integrity of the brain while it is in the
process of being re-written by the parasites.</p>
<p><a name="8bbe"></a>“…You know Princess Khan — if you had
just been kind to the IDF in the beginning, and kept your mouth shut
about Gaza — then we could have actually made good friends.” she
elaborated.</p>
<p><a name="73a8"></a>“We’ve already told you, over and over
again — don’t mess with Israel. Don’t pick a fight with Israel.
Don’t talk bad about Israel on social media — but <i>f*ck</i> me,
right?” she squeezed my nose shut with her latex gloves, and then
pushed my head against the pillow, forcing me to breathe through my
mouth. She then let go, and sat down by the office chair next to me,
typing something into her spreadsheets on her laptop.</p>
<p><a name="f840"></a>“…Does this mean that we all get to be a
family now?” I mustered the strength to push through the phlegm
running down my sore throat.</p>
<p><a name="0ebe"></a>“…Does this mean that we will finally get
to be united as an Planetary Type One Civilization — living in
harmony, forever after? Will you be a kind ruler to us, Maggie? Will
you provide us with affordable housing, universal healthcare, basic
income and guaranteed jobs?”</p>
<p><a name="cb69"></a>“Nope.” She turned around, and giggled.
“Most of you simply do not possess the necessary IQ and genetic
makeup in order to qualify as the worthy inheritors of our New World.
You’re a violent, genocidal and barbaric species, after all —
though I’m sure we could still take control of your bodies, and
<em>make you</em> into one of our own. Just so that we can have
someone to humiliate, and take our anger out on — on a bad day, you
know? Let some steam off, and keep everybody else from going insane…”</p>
<p><a name="3588"></a>“So I was right, then?” I whispered, as I
eyed the digits on my heartrate and blood pressure monitor. “You
don’t actually want what’s best for us. You just need a punching
bag to feel good about yourself, and spread your DNA. Like a
parasitic wasp, infesting a helpless caterpillar with its larvae —
and then killing him in the end?”</p>
<p><a name="3e81"></a>“Exactly.” she stated. “There’s no
greater purpose, or higher meaning to any of this — other than to
just make you suffer, for the sake of <em>making you suffer</em>.
Just because it’s funny. Just because we <strong><em>Can.</em></strong>”</p>
<p><a name="41b8"></a>“Some of you will be of use to us, but most
of you will simply be culled, and left to rot, in order to keep the
global population in check.”</p>
<p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">“That’s life. That’s Nature. It is ruthless, cold and callous — luring you with a carrot, and then sending you to the slaughter… Laughing at your naivety, laughing at your endless attempts at intellectual rationalization, and even laughing at your attempts to get Revenge, and regain Control, by framing you as the villain, and casting you down to the pits of Hell where you belong — where you will forever face the scorn and judgement of all the people you were heroically trying to save — signifying nothing in the end.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><a name="817d"></a><a name="7203"></a><strong>9:09a.m.</strong></p>
<p><a name="3122"></a>The Astromārī⃑an <em>Starseeds</em> were
finally ready to carry their crosses, and make their way to the top
of a grassy hill surrounded by rocks, and cabbage trees. A bit like
the landscapes where the Stonehenge was located, though nowhere near
as cold I guess.</p>
<p><a name="217a"></a>The Tūīs were chirping and singing their
tunes, and the cicadas had only just started to do their clicking,
and buzzing — echoing all through the mountains, and rainforests.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">There were exactly 121 of us, lined up in a row. A 30-something-year-old kiwi bloke named Will Stewart was carrying his own cross in front of me. Behind me was a lady named Natalie Davidson, probably also the same age as us; early 30s, a few wrinkles here and there, baggy eyelids and black circles from all the sleep deprivation, and malnutrition. Most of us had brown, black and dark hair. Roughly half of all the damned were Māori, while the other half was either Caucasian, or Middle Eastern/Semite.</p>
<p><a name="9dd4"></a>“Guess we won’t have to worry about looking
Fat on our high school photo” I joked to myself. “It’s a shame
we didn’t get to have our last meal though. The Loneliness Epidemic
really got the best of us, didn’t it? All alone, with no one to
trust, no one to share a meal with, and no one to turn to when the
proverbial mud hit the fan.”</p>
<p><a name="9e8c"></a>“…Not even the UFOs came down to save us,
in the end. It was all just a swindle, and a scam— manufactured by
the U.S. government in order to keep people distracted from what was
going on in Palestine, and the Ukraine-Russia war.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><a name="3113"></a><strong>12:12p.m.</strong></p>
<p><a name="551e"></a>“Don’t even FOOL yourself into thinking
that you are worthy enough to make it into Heaven! You are a
terrorist, and a <strong>sado-masochist</strong>!” the Fox had
yelled at me from the bottom of my cross — as me, Will and Natalie
endured the burning of the nails, staples and cable ties strapped and
sewed onto our arms, and legs.</p>
<p><a name="d0de"></a>Will was crucified right in the middle, while
me and Natalie were located to his side. I’ve personally never met
this individual, and he didn’t appear to be saying anything at all.
I could only make out his name from the mark that they had stamped on
the back of his neck — with the number “34” next to it.</p>
<p><a name="2a0e"></a>So basically: <i>“WILL STEWART 34”</i>.</p>
<p><a name="9819"></a>Natalie’s number was 44, and mine was 28:
<i>“NATALIE 44, PRINCESS KHAN 28”</i>.</p>
<p><a name="eb2c"></a>“…First time?” I said to Will, in an
attempt to make a final stand in the name of optimism, humor, and
<em>cautiously hopeful naïveté.</em></p>
<p><a name="6f91"></a>“Nope.” he whispered back at me, as his
thigh began to shake — with muscle spasms visible all across his
body.</p>
<p><a name="eb29"></a>My own arms were starting to get painfully
tingly — after which I lost all sensation of practically half of my
body — much in the same way as you would if you had just woken up
after sleeping on your side, with your wrist buried under your hips
or something.</p>
<p><a name="7b5b"></a>The Fox pulled out her pistol, and fired a
warning shot at the man, which pierced right through the side of his
belly — causing him to cough up blood, and bleed ever so slowly.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><a name="a9a5"></a><i>“I
said SHUT UP — and NO TRICKS!” <br>— Magdalene Koch 🇮🇱</i></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><i>6th of December, 2024 —<br>
Raoul Island Weather
Station</i></p>
<p><b>4:44p.m.</b></p>
<p><a name="7981"></a>“Goodbye, <em>Gingerbread Girl</em>.” I
said to Natalie, Will and Princess Khan — as I sipped on a can of
Monster Energy, brushed the locks on my golden hair, and handed out
some Raro, and Power-Rade to the rest of my crew.</p>
<p><a name="e031"></a>“Good job, Mag.” said the admiral Daniel,
sucking on the straws of his own drink, and swirling the ice around
with his thumbs.</p>
<p><a name="06b8"></a>“That’s us then. We made it to Heaven —
<em>Heaven on Earth…</em>” I pulled out a blunt from the
side-pockets of my cargo pants, and lit it up in celebration.</p>
<p><a name="f178"></a>“I wouldn’t worry too much about anything
metaphysical.” said Daniel. “We did whatever we had to do. These
people are terrorists, end of story — now leave the rest up to
<em>God</em>.”</p>
<p><a name="ffea"></a>“Welcome to the Island!” he announced, as
he took a scoop of caviar out of a little bowl on a silver-plated
tray full of biscuits, olives, cheese and oysters — propped up by
the 3d-printed arm of a female, humanoid Android.</p>
<p><a name="67ed"></a>“I thought we weren’t supposed to eat
shellfish?” I laughed at him, as hundreds of soldiers came out of
their tents to join us in.</p>
<p><a name="e66f"></a>“We can <em>now</em>!” he drunkenly
sneered— as he stuffed his face full of olives, cheese, caviar, and
oysters — after which he abruptly collapsed, and fell flat on his
face… with his drink spilling all over the lawn.</p>
<p><a name="504d"></a>“Daniel??” I yelled, as I rushed to the
scene, and picked up his glass. “You <em>OKAY?</em>”</p>
<p><a name="1969"></a>Yet Daniel didn’t say anything, and nor were
any of his vital signs displaying any signs of a breath, or a
heartbeat.</p>
<p><a name="f6f5"></a>Daniel was <strong>dead</strong>. <em>Dead</em>,
dead.</p>
<p><a name="dc5d"></a>“Can somebody HELP?” I screamed, with the
palms of my hands covering my lips — as literally every single one
of our crew members began to feel sick, and collapse — with their
glasses of Raro, and bottles of Powerrade still in their hands, until
there was nobody else left but Me, and the robot holding the silver
tray; paralyzed in the exact same pose, and seemingly inoperable.</p>
<p><a name="3c9b"></a>So I put on my backpack, fastened the laces on
my boots, and set off at a brisk march towards the wooden crosses.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><a name="5c07"></a><strong>6:34p.m.</strong></p>
<p><a name="5689"></a>And there I was — standing right at the
center of the ring of 118 corpses, each one nailed to a cross —
with three of them placed closer to the middle, where I was standing;
forming a triangle when viewed from above which, upon closer
inspection, revealed nothing but a bundle of blankets, and pillows.</p>
<p><a name="15ff"></a>I rushed to have a look at all the other
crosses, but they were empty as well — each one stripped of its
grim occupants and replaced with black duvets and pillows, fluttering
in the wind like the silhouette of a scarecrow.</p>
<p><a name="5bc3"></a>The sun began to dip below the horizon, as the
faint arc of a New Moon emerged, delicate in its Waxing Crescent
phase.</p>
<p><a name="aeda"></a>“Oh well.” I whispered. “Guess I’ll
have the island all to myself, now.”</p>
<p><a name="91c2"></a>I cracked open a bottle of champagne — making
sure that none of its edges had been tempered with. <em>Just in case.</em></p>
<p><a name="9d70"></a>Standing by the edge of the cliff with my right
boot fastened onto a rock — I fired the cork all the way down to
the roof of the station — where hundreds of bodies lay scattered
and piled, like rubbish bags at your average dump site, illuminated
by the automatic flood lights that had come on.</p>
<p><a name="e995"></a>I took a sip out of the bottle — wiping the
froth with the back of my hands, and pulled my golden lighter from
out of the other pocket on my cargo pants — pointing my nose up at
Jupiter in the starry night above, while raising the dagger of flames
with my other hand.</p>
