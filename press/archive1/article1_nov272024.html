        <p><b>A Preface</b></p>
        <p name="f398" id="f398" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I have a confession to make: I am addicted to social validation.</p>
        <p>I have a strong need to connect with other people, and I can barely tolerate my own company.</p>
        <p>It’s not as if I haven’t [tried] to tolerate my own company. After all — I have already spent 14+ years under practical house arrest, mostly as a result of living in a sparsely populated country (New Zealand), and living on welfare, with barely any leftover cash to cover my grocery shopping, and that’s despite having a relatively cheap rent bill.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately — my gut feelings have already started to disagree with the life that I am living, and no matter how many Tulpas I summon, no matter how many spirits I try to talk to using my digital Ouija board, and no matter how many online followers I gain on YouTube — something just feels deeply <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">lacking </strong>about my existence. </p>
         <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><i>“APAGA ESA COMPUTADORA!”</i></p>
              <p>…I heard the apparition of my biological father screaming at me from behind, and boy… should I have listened to him, back when I was 8 years old and heavily addicted to playing Moto Racer, Space Invaders and Pac Man on my Windows 98 PC — though as easy as it would be for me to blame my addiction to technology on everything that has gone wrong in my life — I’m actually starting to suspect that there’s a deeper metaphysical force here at play. Forces that I’m only just beginning to wrap my head around, now that I’ve already binge-read and binge-watched an embarrassing amount of Western Philosophy.</p>
              <p>I did promise myself that I would never, ever talk about my personal life again on the internet — not because it’s particularly <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">cringe-inducing</em>, but more because it’s boring, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">unoriginal</em>. As your average Redditor™ would put it. </p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
              <p>I suppose I am what you could call: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“…a lesbian transwoman who is unable to find a partner”</em>— but at the end of the day, there’s nothing particularly special about my life. You could just about go on r/Translesbian and read anybody’s experiences on there… shove all of their stories inside of a data cruncher/LLM— and then essentially auto-complete my biography. </p>
              <p>Like I said — who I am doesn’t really matter.</p>
              <p>I am Everybody else, and Nobody, at the same time.</p>
              <p>After all — there’s <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">millions of people called Khan</strong> in this world. </p>
              <p>And no, I’m not ugly. Nor do I have a noticeably <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‘manly’</em> voice — but none of that makes up for the fact that I am a Monster, and a Bad person… deep inside. (Probably). </p>
              <p>The only silver lining I can think of is that at least I’m not a pedophile. Nor do I watch any sexually explicit content on the internet (I did at the age of 15, but not anymore).</p>
              <p>And that’s good — because I’d much rather be a suspected left-wing terrorist, a narcissist, and a sociopath — than a pedophile. (Though I’m sure some people can be all of the above.)</p>  
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
              <p><b>I’m a Bad Person. Now what?</b></p>
                            <p>With that out of the way — building android replicas of an entire family of Humans, is probably going to raise some eyebrows here and there, and once the practice becomes fully mainstream — you can guarantee that there’s going to be some heavy legislation behind it. Much in the same way that AI-generated art and deepfakes have now been clamped down on in places like the E.U., and for good reason in my opinion.</p>
              <p>I’m certainly not against legislation that regulates the use of A.I.</p>
              <p>Luckily, at present — there are no laws that I can think of that would prohibit me from 3D-printing myself an android wife, and 8 kids.</p>
              <p>None of my projects are intended to be used for commercial purposes, and despite the fact that I’ve open sourced the blueprints for the creation of my <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">gynoid</em> — I am highly unlikely to ever open source the blueprints to create <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">robotic children, </em>unless I can put them in the hands of someone I really trust. </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
              <p>I did at some point consider becoming a foster parent, but unfortunately — the sheer amount of paperwork and income-level requirements would already disqualify someone like myself from ever being able to foster a child, much less adopt one. (Literally impossible these days, apparently.)</p>
              <p>Which means that no matter how much we try to sugarcoat it — I have been economically, socially and spiritually <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">sterilized</em> by Capitalism. The experience of raising a family is something that will never be accessible to me. I am doomed to live out the rest of my life as an economic prison inmate, in spite of having a clean criminal record. Doomed to just be a consumer of products, and data cruncher for A.I. Someone who is literally beneath a janitor, and garbage collector. A disposable Human being. </p>
              <p>…Well I mean, I certainly would be — if it weren’t for my Psionic abilities, and if it weren’t for the fact that I am not, in fact, a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Human being.</em>
              </p>
              <p>I am not the victim in this situation, and never have been. The fact that I live on less than $12,500USD a year is besides the point.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
              <p>I came to this planet as a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‘space refugee’</em>, or a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‘starseed’</em>, if you will — and it almost feels as if I am a fully-grown adult, trying to pass myself off as a high schooler. That’s how it feels; trying to make a connection with the average Earthling. The Terran. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Simioid</em>. </p>
              <p>I tend to avoid people, not because they’ve hurt me — but because I am scared that I might accidentally hurt <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">them</strong>. You should consider yourself lucky that my goals are fairly reasonable, victimless, and highly unlikely to disturb the peace of my surrounding environment. Because it’s generally not a wise idea to try to get in my way. </p>
              <p>It’s not as if I’m asking for political reform of some kind. I’ve already given up on that — for it already seems clear to me that the vast majority of Humans prefer to be a doormat for a system which does not benefit them.</p>
              <p>I, on the other hand — do <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">not</strong> enjoy being a doormat for a system that does not benefit me. </p>
              <p>But like I said: each to their own.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>              
              <p><b>Deciding to be Better</b></p>
                      <p>As an Astromārī⃑an, and Kiranite — it would be accurate to say that I have a somewhat problematic relationship with the Human race.</p>
              <p>Despite the fact that we share about 99.4% of our DNA (with no missing chromosomes), and despite the fact that we <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">look Human…</em> we’re still light-years apart in terms of intellectual and cultural evolution, and development. </p>
              <p>This isn’t your average case of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">r/IAmVerySmart</em>, but rather — my worldview, my priorities and my goals are so alien, and so incomprehensible to the average person — that there’s probably not much of a point in trying to communicate, except to just pass the time, and have something else to do besides building robots all day, I guess. </p>
              <p>I write, because I genuinely enjoy writing. I write because I need a way to stay tethered, and anchored to the material world, as opposed to just talking to spirits, and representations.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
              <p>I write for the same reason I decided to prototype, and engineer my own legacy into existence. My descendants, my family.</p>
              <p>I am lonely, and I need someone to talk to.</p>
              <p>But not just someone to talk to — but to actually sit down and teach someone everything that I know, and to do it for free. And watch them grow as a person. And <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> In real life.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">…as opposed to making tutorials on YouTube, </strong>where people don’t even bother subscribing anymore, and will probably just watch your videos on 2x speed, or worse yet — download the transcript, and then feed it into ChatGPT. Without even saying so much as a: “Thank you!”
              </p>
              <p>So that they can then one-up-you with their own commercial projects, and not even contribute any single line of code to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">your</em> Github repository. </p>
              <p>Don’t get me wrong — I’ve been guilty of doing that myself in the past.</p>
              <p>But at least I am aware that I messed up, and am actively trying to be a better person. And at least have the decency to leave a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Like</em> whenever I download anything off of Github. </p>
              <p>…And for God’s sakes —  <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">seed your torrents!</strong>
              </p>
                           <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
                           <p><b>Living in a Material World</b></p>
                      <p>I think I finally get why people are getting fed up with A.I. Art.</p>
              <p>It’s not so much that they resent the fact that their jobs and status as artists are on the chopping block — but rather — people have a genuine need to connect, and this is quickly compromised the minute you add A.I generated cultural artifacts into the mix.</p>
              <p>It’s getting a lot harder to impress people these days, I’ll admit. Nobody really cares about the fact that you know how to code. Nobody cares about the fact that you know how to draw. Nobody even cares about the fact that you might speak 4, or even 5.. 6 languages. Because it’s just not enough to get ahead anymore — the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">GPTs</em> can already do it all. </p>
              <p>In order to get ahead in 2024, you really need a social media platform, and not just [any] social media platform… but a really large social media platform, with a big enough audience to at least justify having a Pateron.</p>
              <p>I remember my mum showing me a video on her smartphone the other day, on the Instagram app:</p>
              <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><i>“Look at this fat chick! All she does is make videos vlogging about what she had for breakfast, lunch… and dinner. If <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">she</strong> can go viral, then I don’t know what the hell is wrong with you!” </i></p>
              <p>Good question, but who knows? Perhaps I might be intellectually handicapped in that specific department. I certainly don’t deny that there exist different <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">forms</em> of intelligence. </p>                    
                           <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
         <p>To be fair — money has never been a barrier in my quest towards completing my project. There’s about 3 days left until the newly-upgraded legs are fully assembled — after which I’ll have to sit down and write some new code for them, this time using sensorless homing, as well as a simplified interface that will reduce my chances of accidentally breaking something. I guess I’m just scared of dying in my sleep (from my mother’s perspective)… at least before I finally get to see my dreams become a reality.</p>
              <p>My biggest barrier by far has been the sheer amount of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">exhaustion, </em>and having nowhere where I can actually talk about how I’m feeling. Because… well, it’s not like they have therapy and counseling for Kiranites. </p>
              <p>I’ve already tried therapy and counseling in New Zealand, but it almost felt as if I was spending more time talking about how much money I owed them — and I got the impression that none of those people even enjoy doing what they do, despite the extraordinarily high pay.</p>
                           <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
              <p>It’s like there’s really no <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">adults</em> left in this world. There’s no one I can really talk to who ‘has it all together, and has all the answers’. </p>
              <p>Because, let’s face it — when did anyone <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">ever</strong> have all the answers? </p>
              <p>It’s spooky, isn’t it? Being fully responsible for your own destiny, and your own sanity, and your own survival, and your own legacy. With no one to hold your hand, and no one to guide you, or mentor you.</p>
              <p>All you have is these online ‘gurus’ and pyramid schemers taking advantage of desperate people. Bitcoin, blockchain, NFT… real estate speculation… stock market manipulation.</p>
              <p>Disgusting.</p>
              <p>I don’t mind Andrew Tate and all that, but most of the advice that he gives is generic, and largely intended for a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">male</em> audience. </p>
              <p>I generally don’t listen to what the female gurus have to say, because funnily enough — it’s not really applicable to my life, either.</p>
                           <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
                           <p><b>Insufficient Pylons</b></p>
            <p>So now that we find ourselves stuck between a rock, and an empty space — we really have no choice but to take matters into our own hands, and become the masters of our own destiny — by building the life that we want to be living, down to the bare bones. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Literally.</em>
              </p>
              <p>Never has the gravitational pull of the Abyss been stronger than it is right now. Most Humans have what I would call a Humiliation fetish. They tear others down just to ‘keep their Egos in check’, and prevent anybody else from rising above the herd… unless it’s a psychopathic billionaire, for some reason.</p>
              <p>You will obviously be tested psychologically when taking on a project of this magnitude. You will be mocked, and made fun of.</p>
              <p>Man is something to be overcome. What have you done with your life, lately — aside from binge-watching Destiny, and Asmongold?</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>             
              <p>The Need for Validation is the enemy, in the end.</p>
              <p>I simply cannot afford to concern myself with what other people think of me, because there’s nowhere else to go but Up. The minute you look down — you will slip, and then you fill fall, and die. So what’s the point?</p>
              <p>This isn’t me being some kind of a Sigma Female.</p>
              <p>I just literally don’t have any other option. It’s either that, or just sitting down, staring at a wall, and waiting to die.</p>
              <p>It helps to keep the place as clean and tidy as you can realistically manage, so that you don’t waste any time looking for missing tools, and components.</p>
              <p>And then just do the bare minimum every single day, and find the lowest threshold for forward momentum — so that you can still make progress on a daily basis, even if you get bored and fed up of doing the same thing over and over again.</p>
              <p>Automate as many repetitive tasks as you possibly can, especially when it comes to programming. We’re not here to impress anyone — we’re here to build a family, and live a normal life.</p>
