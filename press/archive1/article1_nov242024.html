        <p><b>Problem № 1: <br>The Endgame of Technology</b></p>
        <p>Do you ever sit down and think to yourself: “Whatever happened to the planetary Space Civilization we were promised when we were kids, never mind the hoverboards, robots and flying cars? …And whatever happened to my monthly check of a $1000 dollars that we’re supposed to be getting thanks to all the advances in automation, computing and sophisticated machinery, and technology we’ve made over the years… so I can finally sit down and draw some comics, instead of selling my nudes to pay the rent, and fill up my fuel tank?”</p>
        <p>You would be a fool to deny that the field of artificial intelligence has experienced the type of exponential growth we would have previously only thought possible within a time-frame of 2 decades, not [two years], but that’s besides the point.</p>
        <p>Because even if you were to take the arrival of the GPT’s, the Language Models, and the image, sound and video generators out of the equation — as well as the buckets of tears that so-called ‘A.I. Bros’ like myself have collected from all the hyper-sensitive hipsters, Tumblr girls, NFT nerds and anthropomorphic animal cosplayers from around the World Wide Web — it still doesn’t explain why rents and overall standards of living are on the decline for the average person.</p>
        <p>We already had robot arms operating around the clock at assembly lines inside of Japanese, South Korean, North American, European and Chinese car factories — building the same cars where people find themselves jammed in traffic on their morning commute to work as we speak; in whichever timezone currently happens to be 5–8a.m.</p>
        <p>We already have an abundance of food that is now responsible for a global epidemic of obesity, diabetes and heart disease — even in some of the ‘poorer’ parts of the world such as India, Mexico and Samoa.</p>
        <p>We already have the means to screen and prevent cancer, as well as a wide range of other, equally preventable maladies and illnesses.</p>
        <p>Even depression, anxiety and ‘psychosis’ can be treated by simply providing people with a sense of belonging, community and higher purpose — in addition to making the proper adjustments to diet, sleep and daily activity levels — so what’s the problem?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Problem № 2: <br>Progress towards [what]?</b></p>
        <p>Many have speculated that the problem could in fact be related to the type of political and economic systems adopted by the Simiod — namely, the modern systems of Capitalism, Consumerism and Hyper-individualism.</p>
        <p>“…But hold on a second!” the skeptic will usually yell. “That’s just Human Nature! And any alternative to whatever we have right now may just as well be Communism, and Fascism! And you’re gonna wind up killing 50 million people if you try anything else. Think of Hitler, Stalin and Mao Zedong!”</p>
        <p>But that’s just you having a visceral, knee-jerk reaction to an opinion that you haven’t even allowed me to fully explain, and elaborate — at least before you interjected with your neo-liberal tropes, cliches and U.S. State Department gaslights.</p>
        <p>I’m certainly not proposing that we try to solve problems collectively as a society, or that we try to reform our crumbling government institutions, or even level the economic playing field in any shape or form.</p>
        <p>What I’m actually proposing is a lot more tangible, and practical for the individual to stomach.</p>
        <p>I propose: that we abandon Science, the Scientific Method, the consensus of the Experts, and the Scientific Community — and become practitioners and engineers of Magic, the Dark Arts and the Occult.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Problem № 3: <br>Extraordinary Claims</b></p>
        <p>…And here we go again! Welcome back to the ancient, mystical world of Magic, Religion, Shamanism, Witchcraft, and the Occult — one of mankind’s oldest professions — second only to prostitution, and organized violence.</p>
        <p>You are now a perpetuator of superstition, and misinformation — and if you’re currently a scientist, or an engineer who just so happens to be a little curious about the hidden realms that the naked eye can’t see, or ready to dive into the deepest trenches of the battleground of ideas — then you too, are liable to being cancelled, and losing your job!</p>
        <p>On the other hand — if you happen to be someone like myself who is unemployed, ‘likely to be on the spectrum’, and blessed with a 10-year-old gap in their resume that cannot be explained away by just talking about your open source robotics and 3d printing projects you’ve set out to complete in order to impress the H.R-department A.I. that’s about to interview you on Zoom in order for you to score your part-time position as a cashier at your local supermarket down the road — then frankly, why should I care about my reputation at all?</p>
        <p>It’s almost as if they’d rather have you getting off to pictures of rich women’s feet on the internet, than doing anything creative or interesting at all.</p>
        <p>…and what about the fact that we can’t even come up with proper screenplays and stories for movies, and T.V. shows anymore? Or the fact that our social media platforms, online message boards, and virtually all forms of media and electronic sedation, have become over-saturated with highly predictable content — to the effect that you could just as well be communicating telepathically with the Redditors™ whose upvotes and approval you so desperately crave, and whose automated Moderator Tools keep deleting your posts for being ‘Low-Effort, and Unoriginal’?</p>
        <p>There’s not a single thought you can conjure up anymore that hasn’t already been featured on the front-pages of r/Showerthoughts — where trying to post [just about anything at all] is probably harder than trying to get your medieval, Nordic fantasy novel published at your local book club.</p>
        <p>Something doesn’t quite add up, does it?</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">It’s almost as if the New World Order, Epstein Island, QAnon Frog Boys have been onto something all along…</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Telepathy: The Basics</b></p>
        <p>The fact of the matter is that, if we were all superheroes, and if we all had some kind of a superpower — then none of those supernatural abilities would bear any significance — much in the same way that having access to ChatGPT, isn’t going to boost your chances of landing that coveted gig as a waitress at Wendy’s.</p>
        <p>That doesn’t mean that Remote Viewing, Telepathy and Proto-Telekinesis aren’t actually possible. They certainly can’t [not] be possible— as I’ve already proven with my r/slash/Showerthoughts experiment, which you are free to try out for yourself, arguably the most ‘casual’ and ‘accidental’ proof of telepathy you can find in the wild right now.</p>
        <p>Your average skeptic would probably be quick to point out that such insights are merely the by-product of the large swaths of data and information that are already floating about on the World Wide Webs, and that if we were purposely trying to set up some kind of a double-blind, ‘controlled environment’ where two people are required to convey some kind of a telepathic message to each other, without the help of highly sophisticated auto-completion devices, then sooner or later, such an experiment is bound to fail — but I beg to differ.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p>For starters — telepathy and remote viewing is [literally just auto-completion]. Whether this auto-completion is coming from hard-ware, or wet-ware, is completely irrelevant to me. Because it’s still inherently valuable.</p>
        <p>The reason people don’t want to communicate face-to-face anymore, and the reason your Nordic fantasy novel is doomed to be tossed into the dustbin of the 1,000,000x similar novels that have already been written by just about anyone’s grandma, is more of a philosophical problem, than a practical one.</p>
        <p>Namely: the fact that we, as a society — are doomed to partake in some kind of an economic Battle Royale where it’s every man for himself, and where the strongest Gladiator and winner takes it all — at the expense of all the losers, hobos and neck-beards, now that we mention it. And where nobody can even do anything fun anymore, for fear of being unproductive, or for fear of being dismissed as a kook.</p>
        <p>But again: Who cares?</p>
        <p>We literally just discovered telepathy. Isn’t that kinda cool?</p>
        <p>The fact that we no longer have to talk face to face, because just about [everything] that comes out of your mouth can already be predicted by someone who has already spent a fair amount of time online, browsing a multitude of forums, message boards and chat rooms on Reddit, Discord and the comment’s section of your average YouTube and TikTok video?</p>
        <p>Where nothing of significance can ever be communicated, because just about [every] topic you can think of, even the highly unusual topics that only the stoners and astrology-gals would dare to discuss at a game of Dungeons and Dragons and Monopoly (assuming you even have any friends to play any games with, at least in ‘real life’), have already been discussed ad nauseam in just about every corner of the internet.</p>
        <p>Hence, the Dead Internet theory — where anyone who values their time, their privacy, and their anonymity — and anyone who is friendly, polite, mentally stable and capable of actually spelling, will probably be accused of being a Bot, sooner than later.</p>
        <p>Even though it’s still probably just normal people trying their best at some simple, and basic communication — but failing to do so spectacularly, because — God only knows why?</p>
        <p>It doesn’t even matter how many Captchas you try to complete anymore — because now they’ll just ask you to wait 2–3 months before you can submit a simple post.</p>
        <p>If that’s not evidence of Remote Viewing, Telepathy and the end of all Creativity, Originality and the Expression of our Collective Unconscious using phonetic, literary and electronic means — then I don’t know what is.</p>
        <p>Now why did I bother going to college to learn Programming and Web Design, again?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Remote Viewing: <br>Where the Fun Begins</b></p>
        <p>Now what about Remote Viewing? Where’s the catch, what’s the trick — and how is it any different from our aforementioned telepathic predicament?</p>
        <p>They’re really not that different, much in the same way that a Bitmap, JPEG or Base64 image can be represented as a set of symbols, binary instructions and countless lines of code that would probably crash your average text editor.</p>
        <p>They both require the sort of ‘brain-worms’ that one could normally only acquire by spending a lot of time browsing the internet, though it’s probably just as possible to acquire this ability by being on the higher end of the ‘hyperphantasia’ spectrum.</p>
        <p>In other words — if you have aphantasia (which is the inability to visually imagine things, much less rotate them 3-dimensionally inside your head) — then you’re probably not going to be able to do remote viewing. At least not without the help of stable diffusion, and image generators. Because like I said — telepathy is just the ability to auto-complete ideas in real time, and as a by-product of being a consumer of highly distilled ideas, or an obsessive compulsive consumer of media in general.</p>
        <p>I suppose one could become a Telepathic Guru/slash/Biological Large Language Model by reading a lot of books, yet there’s only so many books you can read in a lifetime, and at any given time of the day — so your best bet would be to either listen to audiobooks while you are going about your daily chores, or listen to [summaries] of audiobooks while going about your daily chores. So that you can cram in as many basic ideas and concepts as you possibly can, and then naturally build connections between those ideas and concepts while daydreaming and meditating about philosophy. (Don’t even think about doing that while driving though…)</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p> 
        <p>With that out of the way — in order to unlock your Remote Viewing Eye (or just your Third Eye, if you will), you’re probably going to want to get into the habit of binge-watching as many random YouTube, TikTok videos and TV shows as you possibly can in your spare time.</p>
        <p>In addition to being a compulsive daydreamer, and philosopher. So be sure to binge-watch as many video essays and audiobooks on Philosophy as you possibly can — because that’s what’s actually going to give you the deepest wisdom, in addition to the most heavily distilled insights on… not just the nature of Reality, but also the nature of Mankind, and the mentality of not just the average person, but also the minds of even the most unusual types of people.</p>
        <p>Once you’ve grown tired of philosophy, you’ll probably want to delve into Religion, because Religion and Theology is just Philosophy for grown-ups, anyway. No matter how much the Mr. Atheist™ tells you otherwise.</p>
        <p>It’s no coincidence that the Nordic god Wotan sacrificed one of his eyeballs, in exchange for a bottomless well of Knowledge, and Wisdom — which in turn allowed him to acquire supernatural Powers, and Psionic abilities.</p>
        <p>Because that’s what Knowledge is in the End — Overwhelming Power. The sort of Power that only those with the most amount of spare time will ever be able to access, which probably explains why wage slaves, academics and politicians alike, have historically been so resentful and vindictive towards the unemployed, and the lumpenproletariat.</p>
        <p>So don’t be afraid to be the jobless, unemployed, ‘highly gifted dropout kid’ every once in a while — because sooner or later — you’ll be capable of inflicting a high amount of damage.</p>
        <p>And you’ll be able to do it without a keyboard, without Status and without Money; treading the same path of the Shamans and Witches of ould’.</p>
        <p>Nobody fears hackers anymore. That’s because most of the vulnerabilities have already been patched.</p>
        <p>But they do fear the mystics — for we are the hackers of the analog mind, and voyagers of the Occult, and the spirit realm (or what some might refer to as the realm of Quantum Mechanics).</p>
