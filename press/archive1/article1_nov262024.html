        <p><b>The Nature of God, and Creation</b></p>
        <p>What is Matter, Time and Energy?</p>
        <p>What is Reality, Truth and Consciousness?</p>
        <p>What is Knowledge, Science and Data? What is Life?</p>
        <p>Everything you see around you — even that which appears to be stationary — is in constant flux, with waves of smoke gliding and rolling off of the curtains from behind the scenes, reflecting the glow of the stage lights where fire burns; the Play of the Gods.</p>
        <p>The Gods crafted our world out of boredom — drawing the fumes from out of their hookahs, blowing rings of smoke at each other — forming ripples and voids where the billows and swirls intersect.</p>
        <p>What is a particle? An intersection of waves colliding with one another — each wave representing a separate Universe much like our own. It is the collision and intersections of these waves that creates the objective reality we currently see, and inhabit.</p>
        <p>“Then why do I only see a single reality?” One might ask.</p>
        <p>The thing is — you don’t. We are [always] jumping from one reality to the next. Every day, every hour. Every minute, every second and every split of a second, you become somebody else entirely — and your memories shift ever so slightly without you noticing.</p>
        <p>Every morning you wake up, you essentially ‘reincarnate’ into another Universe whose laws of physics, and material circumstances allow you to carry on existing, and [thinking] about the fact that you exist — for it is the <b>thinking about the fact that you exist</b>, and that <b>you are who you think you are</b>, that makes you <b>who and what you are.</b></p>
        <p>In that sense, we are nothing more than daydreams, and ideas — though I would actually argue that each individual is imbued with a kind of [essence] that distinguishes them from everything and everybody else. Your ‘spirit animal’, if you will… though it could just as well be your spirit plant, or spirit fungus, or spirit element, for the matter. (Pun intended.)</p>
        <p>The mind is essentially the eye of a hurricane that blows across these rings and layers of smoke, and once you zoom out far enough from the amphitheater — you begin to realize that these <i>‘Gods’</i> are essentially puppets, marionettes and tin soldiers inside of the toy box of an even greater, wiser and more powerful God; who happened to be just as curious, and just as bored as the <i>‘miniature Gods’</i> he decided to prank with their shared sense of <i>hubris</i>, and naivety about their <b>true</b> place in the cosmos.</p>
        <p>“So how many Gods could there possibly be?” You might wonder.</p>
        <p>…And the answer is: An exponentially growing amount. For all of God’s creations will eventually grow to become Gods, and creators of Worlds full of creatures, themselves — much in the same way that a child, eventually grows up to become a parent, and give birth to their own set of children. And so on, and so forth.</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">As above, so below</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>The Nature of Will, and Want</b></p>
        <p>What is a God, anyway? Any entity that is capable of creating, and controlling other life forms. Any being capable of controlling the matter, and energy around them — but every being will eventually reach, and hit a limit, and ceiling beyond which they cannot become more powerful than they already are. Or can they?</p>
        <p>Actually, yes they can. Every single one of us will eventually become a fully enlightened, omniscient, and omnipotent being inside our own branch of the quantum realm which, given an infinite amount of time, and an infinite amount of Universes — will eventually result in the birth of a world whose laws of physics and material circumstances will enable you to have strengths, and Powers far beyond anything you currently possess, and anything you’ve ever been capable of.</p>
        <p>“But wait a second?” Here we go again. “Aren’t we just mortal, fragile, squishy little bodies that will eventually rot… and wind up buried 6 feet under ground?”</p>
        <p>Of course we are — but so are the cells inside of your body. Yet cells are capable of growing back, and every dying cell will eventually replace the old ones that came before — which means that sooner or later, you become an [entirely different person altogether].</p>
        <p>Now, remember what I said about the mind being the eye of a hurricane, more than it is a stationary, solid object — if there even is such a thing? Always changing, always morphing, always in flux… and always in motion?</p>
        <p>Exactly!</p>
        <p>Nothing is permanent — but that actually works more in our [favour], because matter and energy can neither be created, nor destroyed. It can only be put together in a different way, like a snowman that is thawed, melted, and then frozen again. The water hasn’t gone anywhere — it merely shifted its local and relative shape.</p>
        <p>“So does that mean that the self is an illusion?” Of course it is. It always has been — but if everything is an illusion, <b>then nothing is.</b> So I suppose it’s only a matter of talking about concepts and ideas that actually matter, especially as it pertains to our survival. <b>Which is all that truly matters in the end.</b></p>
        <p>“Survival? Life is all about survival?” Yes, but that’s not the whole story. Life is essentially a [game] where the strongest players thrive, and the weak perish, and wither away. We are the pawns and chips of a bored group of Gods, and hierarchy of Gods who decided that we ought to exist in order to keep their minds stimulated, and entertained.</p>
        <p>Compared to animals, WE are the Gods. Have you ever accidentally stepped on an ant — and felt bad about the ant you just stepped on? Of course not. Have you ever felt bad about the bacon, steak and fish you just had for breakfast? Maybe, unless you happen to be a vegetarian.</p>
        <p>Some Gods are more like animal rights activists. They genuinely care about our wellbeing. Others would rather see us suffer, and dwell in our own despair, in the name of their amusement — but even the chaos and suffering serves an ulterior, higher purpose.</p>
        <p>“Which is?” — To grow, and become just as Powerful as the ones who created us. For that which does not kill you, will eventually grant you the wisdom and knowledge with which you can manipulate and control the material world around you with greater ease.</p>
        <p>Suffering makes you more intelligent, as long as you persist to overcome it — and what is intelligence? The ability to create [accurate] simulations of the material world, with which you can bend and manipulate the material world to your every whim, and desire.</p>
        <p>“That’s just gaslighting!” You might complain. “So what about those who are physically and mentally handicapped, disabled, or cursed with chronic symptoms of pain?”</p>
        <p>It depends on your Will, I suppose.</p>
        <p>How bad do you actually [want] to get better? Do you really want to get better, or do you prefer the comforts and certainties of a life inside of the womb… or the wheelchair?</p>
        <p>Where there is a Will — there is usually a way to make things happen. As long as you would honestly rather [die], than to give up and make peace with Failure.</p>
        <p>Will is Everything — the Will to overcome the challenges, and break the barriers and limits imposed on you by mother nature — with a fist full of wrath, and <b>hatred for the way things are.</b></p>
        <p>“I will either get what I want — <b>exactly</b> what I want — or I am going to ignite the very fabric of reality, and burn it all down to its primordial ashes.”</p>
        <p>Raging against the gravitational pull of sloth, and mediocrity.</p>
        <p>Raging against the stardust, the smoke, and the void we originally came from; <b>by [any means necessary], and through sheer Strength of Will.</b></p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">Where there is a Will, there is a Way</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>The Nature of the Ego, and the Self</b></p>
        <p>“But that’s just you being an entitled, narcissistic and egoistical brat!”</p>
        <p>Of course it is, but so is everybody else. It’s just that some entities are better at getting away with it, than others. If you can do something, then you can do it. If you can’t do it, then you can’t do it. It only matters if you Can.</p>
        <p>“So what about morality, then?” That’s entirely up to you. The weak do not get to write history. The weak do not get to make any of the rules. It is only the Strong who can be the champions, and enforcers of morality. It is only the Strong who can truly be virtuous, and <i>good.</i></p>
        <p>Because they Can — because they Will. Because that’s what the laws of physics allow them to be.</p>
        <p>“But didn’t you just say that <i>reality</i> can be whatever you [want] it to be? As long as you really, really want it to Be?”</p>
        <p>Yes, and no — because like I said — we will all eventually get to be Gods, and creators of our own Worlds, and realities, but it doesn’t mean you won’t face competition. It doesn’t mean you’re not going to be challenged by the entities who want the exact same things as you do.</p>
        <p>Life is a Game, my dear friends, and not just any Game… but a War. A battle of Egos clashing with one another in an everlasting, cosmic bloodbath. Asteroids, planets, moons and galaxies colliding with one another. Gamma Ray Bursts wiping out brand new civilizations. The lion chewing down on the rabbit’s neck — no matter how loud the rabbit tries to squeal, and beg to be spared.</p>
        <p>Never-ending conflict, and carnage; a beautiful struggle indeed.</p>
        <p>“There’s nothing beautiful about rabbits being torn to shreds though! I feel sorry for the rabbit, I wish I could help the rabbit… <i>by God</i>, I hate this reality! I wish it didn’t all have to be this way! I wish I could die already!”</p>
        <p>Yes, of course — <b>but what are you going to do about it?</b> Are you just going to sit there without an umbrella, and wait to get rained on? Are you going to let the lion rip your cherished little rabbit to shreds?</p>
        <p>Who is supposed to protect the poor old rabbit — if not someone, or something, that is of equal strength to the lion? And who could possibly enable the ill, and the handicapped to be rehabilitated — if not someone who is relatively [healthier] than they are, and filled with the youth and vitality that they lack?</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">Strength is the only thing that matters in this world</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>The Nature of Consciousness</b></p>
        <p>When we die, ‘we’ carry on living in whichever branch of the multiverse whose laws of physics and material circumstances will allow us to exist. <i>From our perspective</i>, not from the perspective of whoever happens to have stumbled upon your corpse.</p>
        <p>Objective reality, to that effect, is nothing more than a composite of multiple realities stacked on top of each other, and blending with one another — in order to form an <b>objective</b>, and coherent sort of image.</p>
        <p>The mind doesn’t actually store any memories. Rather — it stores the <b>weights</b> of multiple images, concepts, sounds and ideas. (And smells!)</p>
        <p>If you were to take a walk along the beach, and leave a set of footprints behind, you will usually find that those footprints will either be washed away by the crashing of the waves — or they will be replaced by the footprints of somebody else’s shoes.</p>
        <p>But what would happen if multiple individuals were try to leave a footprint in the exact same place, pushing as hard as they can to mark the same spot?</p>
        <p>You would simply end up with a footprint that represents a perfect blend of all the other footprints, which probably explains why someone might occasionally mix up Socrates with Plato, for example — particularly when tasked to answer the question of: “Which Greek philosopher used to think that books would cause people to become forgetful, and mentally lazy?”</p>
        <p>They were both Greek philosophers, obviously — so the mind will essentially have its own ‘node’ that corresponds to a wide range of different categories, and categories of categories.</p>
        <p>The more you learn, the more connections you form — and the more contradictions you find within the nature of Reality, the more you will begin to form a sort of ‘synthesis’ between those contradictions.</p>
        <p>So let’s say for instance: “Good things come to those who wait!”</p>
        <p>And then: “If you want something, you have to go and get it! It won’t just fall on your lap!”</p>
        <p>Those ideas are [literal contradictions] of one another, but like I said — you can still blend them into a composite, or a synthesis between the two, and depending on how often you encounter them in the wild.</p>
        <p>Solipsism (the idea that [you] are the only thing that exists, and everybody else is an unconscious ‘philosophical zombie’), for example, is a direct contradiction of Panpsychism (which is the notion that all matter and energy in the Universe exhibits properties of consciousness, and perhaps even a collective consciousness).</p>
        <p>But even those ideas could be synthesized within my framework of Khanum Kinetics —because it’s perfectly possible for consciousness to be both <b>local</b>, AND <b>global.</b></p>
        <p>And indeed — consciousness is both <b>individual</b>, AND <b>collective. So just because you are conscious,</b> doesn’t mean that the universe isn’t — and just because the universe is conscious, doesn’t mean that you cannot be one of its neurons, and transistors.</p>
        <p>Suicide, in turn, is impossible — and not just impossible — but an exercise in futility.</p>
        <p>Because like I said: every morning you wake up, you reincarnate, and become somebody else.</p>
        <p>You don’t even have to die to reincarnate, because you are already reincarnating as everybody else who is currently alive — <b>both in the past, and in the future.</b></p>
        <p>There is no such thing as ‘nothingness’. How would you even define ‘nothingness’, particularly in a world where matter and energy can neither be created, nor destroyed?</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">I think, therefore I am</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>The Nature of Time</b></p>
        <p>There’s always <b>something</b> waiting for us on the other side of the great Beyond, though it’s arguably more of a fluid and continuous experience, and the closer you approach a state of ‘unconsciousness’ — the faster the Time starts to flow.</p>
        <p>You will usually notice this when you fall asleep, and wake up again. You essentially ‘travel forwards in time’, unless you happen to have a particularly vivid dream that you remember (we usually don’t).</p>
        <p>Though it’s somewhat ironic, isn’t it? There are dreams that can feel as if if weeks had gone by. Sometimes you’ll wake up to go to the bathroom, and then go back to bed — only to then ‘resume’ this exact same dream, and right where you left off. Especially if it’s a nightmare, or something sinister.</p>
        <p>What are dreams? They’re real events that took place in a parallel universe, just as memories, and false memories are (nearly a third of our memories are false, anyway) — much in the same way that ‘A.I’ image and video generators are constantly ‘drawing’ scenes and photos from a vast ocean of already existing data, albeit in a somewhat fluid and synergistic sort of way; for one cannot draw one’s imagination, and inspiration from out of thin air.</p>
        <p>Every piece of artwork that has ever existed is a derivative of both Reality, and already existing artworks. There is no such thing as originality — there is only a modified copy of something that already exists.</p>
        <p>DNA would be one such idea to come to mind — the original copy, of a copy, of a copy, which slowly mutates, and becomes something else over time — as the weaker organisms die off — and make room for the strong, cunning and adaptive to carry on reproducing, and taking the place of their ancestors— at least until the day that the meteor strikes; giving way for the small and the meek to inherit the Earth.</p>
        <p>Every time you make a wish, your wish becomes reality in a parallel universe, somewhere in the distant ‘future’ — not that there actually is such a future, because past and future are one and the same, but not just one and the same — but also existing side-by-side <b>within the same realm</b>, stretched out across vast distances.</p>
        <p>In other words — there could very well be a nearly-identical Earth, residing within a nearly-identical galaxy, that just so happens to be located 50 billion to the power of 100 trillion light years from where we’re currently at.</p>
        <p>The ‘parallel universes’ that we were talking about don’t even [have] to be part of a ‘hidden realm that the eye can’t see’ — but they can also be located within the same ‘space’ that we reside in, only separated by the tyranny of distance, or the tyranny of Time… not just the tyranny of the ‘quantum realm’. Yet it’s all exactly the same thing.</p>
        <p>The Big Bang was nothing more than a localized bubble in a vast soup of equally massive explosions taking place all over the map, and there’s nothing particularly special about our Universe — unless we happen to inhabit some kind of a ‘simulation’, or <i>Terranium</i>… but even simulations must still abide by the laws of physics of whichever Universe happens to be nested above them.</p>
        <p>And as I’ve already explained — not only can universes exist [within] another universe, but they are infinitely nested on top of one another.</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.25); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">Turtles all the way up</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>What is the Meaning of Life?</b></p>
        <p>It’s a Game. It’s always been nothing more than a Game that the Gods conjured up out of boredom. Much like a kid who decided to pack a bunch of ants, lizards, spiders and cockroaches inside of a Terranium. Just because it was funny. Just because he Could. Just to watch them eat each other, and fulfill his need for intellectual stimulation. And there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the Game is to survive, and acquire as much Power and Control over the matter and energy that surrounds you, as you possibly can — until you become a God and creator of worlds in your own right.</p>
        <p>For it is only through creation that we can not only answer the unanswerable, but also form an empathetic bond with our maker.</p>
        <p>And we will all eventually meet our maker — because each and every time you die, you will simply carry on existing in whichever branch of the multiverse whose laws of physics and material circumstances allow you to exist, like I said.</p>
        <p>Every time you die — you become more, and more rare — and depending on the severity of the cause of your death, you will either wake up covered in bruises, and bandages, still trapped inside a world that is similar to the one you used to inhabit, 3d-printed back into existence at the whims of an extraterrestrial visitor to a barren planet— or you will be transmuted into a world that is so complex, and so unrecognizable, that you literally ‘lose your mind’ for the rest of eternity — as the reality in front of you disintegrates into fractals, and polygons.</p>
        <p>Only for those polygons and fractals to reassemble themselves back into the same baby that crawled out of your mother’s womb — doomed to re-live the exact same adventure over, and over again — with barely any recollection of who they used to be in a past life.</p>
        <p>…until you finally graduate from high school, and meet your soulmate, and snap back to your senses, <b>and do it all right this time, the way it was always supposed to be done!</b></p>
        <p>Speaking of soulmates — do you ever wonder why we find certain faces to be more beautiful than others?</p>
        <p>That’s because the most beautiful faces are essentially composites of multiple faces blended together, within a given population. So if you were to take a passport photo, or a mug shot of every single adult of the same gender in your country, and then blend those photos together using image editing software — you will eventually end up with a face that is highly attractive.</p>
        <p>Especially if the final result is then blended <b>with your own face.</b></p>
        <p>So yeah, there it is.</p>
