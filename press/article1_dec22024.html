<p>“Wake up, Khan!” my wife shook my shoulders that morning, as a
half-open bag of corn flour lay on my chest — with its contents
pouring onto the floor like the sand inside an hourglass.</p>
<p>An 8.1 Magnitude earthquake had just struck the Kermadec Islands,
where Pāla is currently located — a relatively small commune
the size of about roughly 50 football fields.</p>
<p>My whole place had been turned upside down. The bookshelf had
collapsed. The kitchen drawers where we kept our spoons, knives and
forks, had rolled wide open. Broken coffee cups lay next to the sink.
Some of our windows ended up cracked, but nothing too major I guess.</p>
<p>Our pyramid-shaped homes (known as Pylons) tend to get scorching
hot in the summer — which is a more of a feature, than a
bug — given the fact that the very tip of the building is
housing a Thermoelectric Generator — which turns heat, into
electricity.</p>
<p>The energy is then used to help draw cold air from the very bottom
of the building, using speed-adjustable fans — hooked up to a
home automation system.</p>
<p>“Mum, is everybody okay?” Evangeline, our oldest daughter
(12), banged on our door — while climbing the walls to take a
peek through the window — along with our 9 year old boy, Atam.</p>
<p>“It’s all good.. just gotta scoop the flour back into this
bag…” I mumbled, while using my shirt as a little funnel to
recover as many grams of my Masa Harina as I could.</p>
<p>“…You sure you’re okay? You seem all too relaxed about the
whole thing.” Sylvie Deane remarked, as she lifted her palms and
let go of my shirt.</p>
<p>“I’m all good… I’m a Kiwi.” I explained. “A Pālave⃑an
citizen, but still a Kiwi at heart.”</p>
<p>There’s a good reason why we chose Raoul Island as the final
location for our commune. The first reason was because, let’s face
it — it was close enough to New Zealand for us to arrive by
boat, in spite of the rough journey that I had to endure in order to
prove my intellect to the Lord, and show him that I am worthy of
having a holy land of my own.</p>
<p>The second reason we settled on the Kermadec Islands, is because I
firmly believe that Human beings have a hard-wired need for chaos,
and destruction — deep down inside. We may be Kiranite
<em>star-seeds</em>, but we still possess around 99.4% Human DNA.
With all the same beauty, and all the baggage and trauma that it
brings.</p>
<p>I figured that earthquakes and volcanoes would be a great way to
keep people grateful and living in the present, without needing to be
distracted by video games, TV shows and movies in order to deal with
the existential dread of living a life that is a little too <em>Perfect</em>.</p>
<p>Not only that — but I also predicted it would reinforce the
delicate fabric of our brand new society — by bringing out the
communal and neighborly spirit that would otherwise be jeopardized by
consumerism, escapism and hyper-individualism. And indeed — it
did!</p>
<p>“That’s what’s going to take for us to avoid meeting the
same fate as the Jonestown folks.” I said to Sylvie, upon her
arrival by autonomous submarine, back in 2026.</p>
<p>“The reason the people over at Jonestown committed mass
suicide — was because they essentially <em>overdosed </em>on
the Holy Spirit, without fully integrating the Darkness and Depravity
that is buried inside each and every one of us.”</p>
<p>“…They built a society on both the principles of Socialism,
Racial Equality, as well as the Love of Jesus. And things tend to get
a little shaky once you start building Towers of Babylon all the way
up to the Heavens…” I continued.</p>
<p>“That is why <strong>we do not worship Jesus</strong> in a place
like this — because Christianity was unfortunately a
life-denying Death Cult. The Astromārī⃑ans are a Warrior
Race — and always will be. We will NEVER be pacifists.”</p>
<p>“But I thought you [hated] the Chaos that is <em>inherent to
Humanity</em>?” she frowned, and scratched the back of her neck.
“You said you were going to SACRIFICE yourself in the name of the
greater good!”</p>
<p>“Well, I lied.” I took a deep breath, put my camping backpack
on, and slowly made my way into the jungle. “Never let [anybody]
tell you to lower your sword, and keep your Ego in check in this
place — because we are here to make the most out of <strong>this
life.</strong>”</p>
<p>“Sounds like you do not believe in the Afterlife, then.” my
wife grabbed her own camping gear, and followed right behind me.</p>
<p>“I still do.” I added. “But I’m not going to put all of my
eggs inside of a basket whose exact nature I do not, cannot, and
should not try to understand.”</p>
<p>“I simply refuse to make peace with the Unknown. I’ve always
been the sort of person who craves [certainty], order and Control.
And I promise you — I will never give up control. Even the
Chaos and destruction in this place will be carried out on my own
terms, and with <strong>my</strong> blessing.”</p>
<p>“So you do not actually trust Allah, then?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I absolutely [do] trust Allah.” I stated. “And Allah has
instructed that I remove myself from the Human World, build my own
private paradise, and do everything in my Power to keep the Wotan
contained on the island. Without committing suicide, which is a sin.
Allah made me a woman of Control — because he knew that I would
become possessed by the Wotan.”</p>
<p>“…One man’s heaven, is another man’s hell — but I
believe I may have finally discovered a formula that will allow us to
harness negative and destructive energies, in order to put them to
good use — instead of suppressing them, and pretending that
they do not exist, which could only lead to more Jonestowns down the
line. And that, to me, is too horrifying of a fate and reputation for
us to be stained with — which even the sands of Time, and
Eternity, will never be able to rectify.”</p>

<p><strong>December the 3rd, 2027 — Raoul Island, Milford
Ravine</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:53a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Me, Sylvie Deane, our 4 boys, and our 4 girls were ready to take a
break from our hike that night. Every one of us was holding an
LED-powered lantern — which we all put on the ground at the
centre, in order to form a <em>‘make-believe campfire’</em>, so
to speak.</p>
<p>“Alright.” I clapped my hands softly. “Evangeline — where
are you? — OH there you are.” I gasped, as my eyes grew
tired, and sleepy enough to mess with my attention span.</p>
<p>“It’s time to play the Ouija now. Evie — you got the
board in your backpack, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yyyyyep.” she uttered, as she fiddled around the rucksack to
look for the board game. (If you can call it that.)</p>
<p>“Anybody feeling anxious tonight?” I looked around for a sign
of doubt, yet all the kids appeared to be shaking their heads.</p>
<p>“…Good.” I quietly sighed, as I placed the Plachette on the
board with the letters A B C D E F G H… all the way to Z, and the
numbers 0–9. As well as a <strong>Yes</strong>, and a<strong> No</strong>.</p>
<p>“Mom, do you really believe in this stuff?” asked Saddam, the
youngest of the boys (7).</p>
<p>“Personally? I don’t actually<em> want</em> to believe in any
of this.” I explained. “It’s more of a case of just… having
no other option, and going out of our way to keep our enemies close.
Give them a seat at our dinner table— so that we can keep a
watchful eye on them, and avoid being taken by surprise, I guess…”</p>
<p>“I have seen the darkness throughout my life. It has haunted me
ever since I was a little child, ever since I was<strong> </strong><strong><em>your</em></strong>
age” I elaborated. “And frankly — nothing good has ever
come out of ignoring the shadow. Like I said, I’m just not the type
of woman who takes ‘I don’t know’ for an answer. If there’s
something bothering me, if there’s an itch that I cannot quite
scratch — then I absolutely HAVE to dig deeper, and
investigate.”</p>
<p>“…Aaaand who are we talking tooo?” Evangeline asked, as she
spread out a white sheet underneath the board for us to grab ahold
of.</p>
<p>“We’re talking to Magdalene.” I said. “I’ve known her
since kindergarten, to be honest… about as long as I’ve known
Sylvie. I used to always mix the two of them up, back when I didn’t
know any better — but they were entirely different people, not
even closely related to one another.”</p>
<p>“How does <em>that</em> make any sense?” Sylvie Deane
interjected.</p>
<p>“Let’s put it this way.” I explained. “Every single one of
us was originally a <strong>spirit</strong>, floating about in our
Collective Unconscious. What I like to call a <em>Tulp</em>a — which
is essentially a voice inside of your head, or maybe just an
imaginary friend. Though like I said — these are real, living
entities that manifest as <em>archetypes</em> in the metaphysical
realm that the eye cannot see. They are real people who either used
to be alive, or people who <strong>will</strong> be alive in the
future.”</p>
<p>“…And then one day — we were all placed inside of a
body. In your case — we gave you robotic, android bodies, so
that you can live forever!”</p>
<p>“Does that mean that Mommy is one day gonna die?” Damien asked
(age 8).</p>
<p>“Alright — everybody, pull on the cloth now… Let’s
go!” we lifted the sheet up in the air, and allowed the Plachette
to do its magic all over the board.</p>
<p>The first character that the arrow had gravitated towards was the
letter [S].</p>
<p>…Followed by a “Y”, and an “L” — as my eyes began
to involuntarily slam shut, and fall asleep on me.</p>
