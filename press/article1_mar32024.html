            <p align="center" style="font-weight: normal"> <i>March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024 â€“ by Princess Khan</i>
            </p>
            <!-- Article Body Start -->
            <p align="center"> <br /> <br />
            </p>
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">One simple truth I have learned over the years, is that Weakness corrupts &ndash; and absolute Weakness corrupts absolutely.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />           
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Simply put: Being Weak leaves you at the mercy of the elements, and your Fate; at the whims of the Strong and Powerful.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">That's not to say that being a Weak individual necessarily makes you a bad person, or that the Weak are deserving of the bullying and contempt of other people.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Rather &ndash; when things go South, and when help is unavailable &ndash; you're practically forsaken, and doomed to helplessly stare into the void, all by yourself.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">We also live in a world full of cowards who surround themselves with armed guards and mercenaries in order to protect their lavish and decadent lifestyles, despite the extensive amount of damage they perpetuate unto the environment, and the society that feeds them.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">You have Twitch streamers, TikTokkers and YouTubers who make a living as 'Left-wing Political Commentators' who just so happen to be wealthy enough to house, feed, clothe and pay for the healthcare of more than a dozen people, many times over.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...and likewise, we also have 'Democratically-elected' Politicians who do the exact same, albeit with a higher degree of blatant, unadulterated Honesty.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Our elected officials no longer even seem to bother hiding the fact that they're pocketing the tax-payer's money in order to stay at their 5-star-hotels, and host their own cocaine-fueled orgies and parties.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Probably because the people who voted for them, are far too sedated and distracted to do anything about it &ndash; with their Rugby, Cricket, TikTok, Netflix, KFC, Uber Eats and cheap sugary buns from the supermarket.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">You probably already know that I love to go to bed counting dead politicians with my imaginary shotgun, yet I also have to bargain with reality and make a plan for an alternate society that I can sustainably build on my own.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It's one thing to riot, stir up trouble, and get a bunch of idiots riled up in a crowd.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It's another thing to actually build a successful society that isn't going to fall apart to a counter-revolution.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">As much as people hate the so-called 'Tankies' and Dirt-Bag Leftists, they are unfortunately the only type of Leftists who are grounded in Reality.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">For all it takes to debunk an 'Anarcho-Communist', is to simply walk up to them and ask them if they wish to join a Commune.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Chances are &ndash; your request will only be met with ridicule, derision, and even disgust.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I highly doubt that those people are even capable of sharing a living space with a roommate, let alone organizing any kind of alternate society.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I doubt they even have the social intelligence to court a romantic partner, let alone make a friend <i>in real life</i>.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And generally speaking &ndash; the larger your population, the harder you have to work in order to keep things from falling apart &ndash; or just defaulting back to Tribalism, Capitalism and the Survival of the Fittest.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Yet even the Tankies may be wasting their time trying to spread their Marxist-Leninist, Maoist and anti-Western political ideologies on corporate-owned social media platforms.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Mostly because their communities have amounted to nothing more than nostalgic Fandoms for the long-gone civilizations of the past.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...if not Fandoms for 'authoritarian' regimes whose systems we cannot, and should not be trying to emulate here in the West.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I personally couldn't care less if either Vlodymyr Zelenskyy, or Vladimir Putin emerged as victors in the Ukraine-Russia War.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Because whoever wins: <b>We Lose.</b></span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">That is &ndash; We the People here in the West who just want Healthcare, Affordable Housing, Guaranteed Minimum Income, guaranteed employment and/or student debt forgiveness.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Instead of, you know &ndash; giving up more than a fifth of our GDP in order to feed the military industrial complex; literally selling weapons, drones and killing-machines to the belligerents of both sides of the conflict.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">With that out of the way &ndash; I no longer think it's possible for the Human species to ever wage what you might call a genuine 'Class War'.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />            
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Fascism, Monarchism, Barbarism, Capitalism and Feudalism have permeated the overwhelming majority of Human history.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />            
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And there may in fact be a kind of 'genetic component' that influences the manner in which we structure and organize our hierarchical, status-driven societies.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Try calling for a Fascist or a Monarchist Uprising &ndash; and you'll have a huge crowd of sweaty, testosterone-fueled morons ready to join you in with pitchforks and torches.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Try calling for a Socialist Revolution &ndash; and you'll probably just be stabbed and beaten up by a bunch of teenagers, and gang-members in public.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It takes a whole lot of explaining, teaching and social engineering in order to spread Left-wing ideas.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Right-wing ideas, on the other hand &ndash; require virtually [zero] marketing.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Hence, the phrase 'The Left Can't Meme'.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Probably because Human Nature is already right-wing by default. At least Male Nature.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Yet it is only Young Men who are actually capable of overthrowing governments and carrying out a Revolution, in addition to actually running their societies.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">So there's really no point in perpetuating such idiotic, culture-warrior-esque sentiments that Women are supposedly Good, and Men are Bad, or vice versa.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Because at the end of the day &ndash; even the so-called 'Gyno-Centric' societies are still almost exclusively run by Men. 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...Just not the ones who are poor, underemployed and single.</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And thus &ndash; the Women, minorities and gender-queer individuals who populate these 'Woke', 'Gyno-centric' societies are nothing more than a Mascot.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Just because the Kangaroo is the national symbol of Australia, doesn't mean that there aren't dead Kangaroos plastered all over their roads, and highways.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Wokeness must therefore be opposed at any given opportunity &ndash; for it is no sign of Civility to be peaceful and kind in an unjust society.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />            
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">So <i><b>what is to be done</b></i>, now that we've internalized such disappointing Truths about the Human condition?</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">How can you wage a one-man-war against a world where everybody is against you?</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">The answers can obviously only be discovered by means of Individual Initiative.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">You as an Individual, living in an Age of Information, have a lot more Power than you would otherwise believe.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Simply swapping your Windows and Macintosh operating systems for a Linux-based distribution, would already be enough to burn a hole in the wallets of multi-national Tech Corporations.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Just as installing Ad-Block, and switching over to decentralized social media platforms, would burn a hole in the wallets of the Mark Zuckerberg-s and Elon Musk-s of the world.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Something so simple and convenient, must almost certainly be <i><b>too good to be true</b></i>, am I right?</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Well not exactly.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It was the convenience and simplicity of the Hashtag, the Taxi App, and the Infinite Scroll &ndash; which gave rise to Twitter, Uber, YouTube and TikTok &ndash; giving birth to one of the wealthiest and most Powerful human beings who have ever walked the surface of the Earth.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It was [you] sitting comfortably behind your computer screen, munching on pizza and Doritos, who made them wealthy.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />            
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And likewise &ndash; it can only be you, Mr. Keyboard Warrior, who can take all of that wealth away from them. By simply uninstalling their apps, and refusing to pay for their services.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Something that could just as easily be achieved by using The Pirate Bay instead of Amazon Prime, or Invidious instead of YouTube, for the matter.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Yet even a digital, internet-based Proletarian Revolt is still nothing more than a pipe dream.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Probably because the <i>Terminally-Online Left</i> have already resigned themselves to living within a Capitalist framework and mode of production, and means of exchanging ideas, and services.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Nobody really has the energy to do anything more interesting than working a job, and consuming/creating digital content for giant social media companies in their spare time.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Just look at how militantly the online Art community have come to the defense of Intellectual Property, and Copyright Law &ndash; two massive institutions that overwhelmingly favour wealthy conglomorates such as Disney and Microsoft, more than they will ever benefit the common man.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It used to be that Millennials and young kids could at least have the capacity to rebel against the movie industry, and the record labels by pirating movies, and music albums.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Nowadays they're barely even capable of rebelling against their Parents.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">That's not to say that being a 'Linux-bro', or an AI Artist will necessarily make you a genuine Rebel, or anything along those lines.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Rather &ndash; people in the modern age are so mentally Weak, and domesticated &ndash; that even something as insignificant as having to choose between commercial software, and Free and Open Source alternatives, is already far too much to ask from them.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">The problem isn't [just] that you're a kitty who cannot open up a window, and run off into the wild.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">The problem is that you're a kitty who can't even mark their territory &ndash; let alone scratch their owner in the face, or so much as even hiss at them.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">So never mind the fact that you don't have any balls &ndash; you don't actually have [claws] anymore.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Hence, the World Economic Forum motto: <b>"You will own Nothing, and you will be Happy!"</b></span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Also known as: <b>"You will be a little sl*t, and you won't even moan when taken from behind."</b></span> 
            </p><br /> <br />            
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.4em">...</span>
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I am going to be honest with you though &ndash; there's probably not a lot of use in letting out a squeak, now that you're doomed to be permanently <i>fisted</i> for the rest of eternity.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">We are, after all, living at the <b><i>End of History</i></b> &ndash; in which Neoliberal, Capitalist 'Democracy' has crowned itself as the last political and economic system we will ever devise.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">You're far more likely to get people excited and riled up by talking about Antinatalism, or the Apocalypse, and the End of the World, than you ever would by talking about the End of Capitalism.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And indeed &ndash; the only way to get rid of Capitalism, would be to get rid of the Human Race altogether.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Or at least &ndash; <i><b>the Human Race as we know it.</b></i></span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">For there's ultimately nothing preventing us from selectively breeding a race of altruistic Super-Humans in order to bulldoze the barriers getting in the way of our social and cultural progress, and evolution.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And so the final answer to the question: <b><i>"What is to be done?"</i></b> may actually be found within the realm of Transhumanism, Accelerationism and all that is inspired by science-fiction.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">As long as you have the proper level of awareness, respect and acknowledgment for the sheer amount of work and effort required to put the bong down, step away from the drawing board, and transform these visions into Reality.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">The reason we can't have <b><i>Nice Things</i></b>, is because <b><i>Nice Things</i></b> take a lot of work in order to build, and maintain &ndash; nevermind having to wrestle with Entropy, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and the Cosmic Speed Limit.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">So for lack of a better term: The [nicer] the thing, the [more work] you have to put in, in order to attain it, and in order to keep it.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">It takes a lot less thinking, and a lot less physical energy to create a glass of water from scratch, than it is to create a pile of stones.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">And a glass of water is generally a lot more useful in our day-to-day lives, than a pile of stones ever will be.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Just as it would take a lot more thinking and physical energy to run a successful Socialist Commune, than it would be to just have a bunch of drug-fueled orgies and violent free-for-alls where everybody just does whatever the hell they want.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">Entropy is thus the ultimate Show-Stopper, and the reason why you cannot have <b><i>Nice Things.</i></b> i.e. Affordable Housing, Healthcare and Universal Basic Income.</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
            <p align="center"> <span style="font-weight: normal">...or is it?</span> 
            </p><br /> <br />
