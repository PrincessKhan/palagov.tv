<p><b>9:1</b> “Welcome aboard the PANAM Airlines!” the Lady’s voice had announced through the Speakers along the top of the Cabin. “Don’t forget to switch your Phones off—and hand them over to one of our Flight Attendants—who will soon be coming along with some Meals, some Tea, and some Coffee after Take-off!”</p>
<p><b>9:2</b> “So where are [you] from?” a Gentleman sitting next to the Princess, by the Porthole, set out to break the Ice, to which the Princess replied: “I’m from Venezuela. Terran Venezuela. I was actually born in Moscow, Russia. But then my Dad decided to take me and my Mum back to Venezuela. After which we then moved to Terran Zealandia… then back to Venezuela… then to the German Reich… then back to Venezuela, and then finally—after my Mum filed for a Divorce—she took me back to Terran Zealandia!”</p>
<p><b>9:3</b> “Oh, wow!” the Man remarked, and pulled off his Glasses to give them a wipe. “You’re well-travelled. I’m assuming you’re also highly cultured, and well-read, judging by the Book you’re holding in your Hands—Civilization and its Discontents… by Sigmund Freud? Is that right?”</p>
<p><b>9:4</b> “Yes. It is, indeed.” Princess Khan nodded, and clapped the Book shut with a Page Marker jammed in-between. “By the way… what’s your opinion on Universal Basic Income?”</p>
<p><b>9:5</b> “I don’t really have an opinion on UBI”. The Man said to her. “What I do know is that we are approaching an Age where things like Basic Necessities, and even Housing are now being considered as the next big Leap in the Domain of Human Rights. But I’m kind of skeptical that we’ll even get there in the first place. I’m not even sure if we [should], to be honest…” </p>
<p><b>9:6</b> “Fair enough. Now if you’ll excuse me…” she continued. “I’m just going to have a 15-minute Nap!” she slipped the Book into one of the Pockets at the back of the Seat in front of her, leaned her own Seat back, and brought her Hands together in a solemn Gesture of Prayer. With her Eyes closed, and her nose Pointed straight up towards the Ceiling. “Allah is the Mightiest!” she opened her Prayer with the Takbeer, without uttering the Words out loud to the rest of the Passengers.</p>
<p><b>9:7</b> “In the name of Allah—the most Gracious—and the most Merciful”.</p>
<p><b>9:8</b> “Praise be to Allah—the Lord of the Whole Universe!”</p>
<p><b>9:9</b> “The Most Gracious, and the Most Merciful.”</p>
<p><b>9:10</b> “You are Lord from Beyond the Earth.“</p>
<p><b>9:11</b> “You are the Master of the Day of Judgment.”</p>
<p><b>9:12</b> “You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.”</p>
<p><b>9:13</b> “Guide us to the Righteous, the Holiest and the Hardest path.”</p>
<p><b>9:14</b> “You are Lord from Beyond the Earth—and we are Loyal Until the End!”</p>
<p><b>9:15</b> “May the Peace and Mercy of Allah be upon us!”</p>
<p><b>9:16</b> “Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah!”</p>
<p><b>9:17</b> All Promethean Kiranites must pray towards the Cetus Constellation, where the YZ Ceti Star-System is located, which you can easily track using Star-Gazing Software.</p>
<p><b>9:18</b> YZ Ceti is a Red Dwarf Star. Red Dwarf Stars have very low mass, and burn their Fuel very, very slowly, and thus—they will outlast the Sun of the Terran Star-System for Billions, and even Trillions of Years!</p>
<p><b>9:19</b> The YZ Ceti Star-System is home to 3 Earth-Sized Exoplanets: YZ Ceti B, YZ Ceti C and YZ Ceti D.</p>
<p><b>9:20</b> YZ Ceti B is known to us as Planet Kīran, Home of the Astromarian Race—Voyagers of both the Oceans, and the Void of Outer Space—most commonly referred to as the Kiranites; ascendants of the Kiranite Starseeds.</p>
<p><b>9:21</b> Starseeds are Jinn who have mated with Human Beings—thereby producing Offspring of higher Intelligence and Psionic Ability—albeit socially introverted, and with shorter Attention Spans.</p>
<p><b>9:22</b> The PanAmerican Airliner was cleared for Take-off, as its Wheels began to gently bounce, along with the rattling of the Walls of the Cabin. The Flight had departed from Auckland Airport, Terran Zealandia, and was headed for Santiago de Chile; for in order to make it to Caracas, Terran Venezuela—one had to first make a Stop at the Chilean Capital. Followed by yet another stop at Lima, Peru.</p>
<p><b>9:23</b> “Excuse me, Ma’am—would you like a Coffee?" the Flight attendant had arrived with her Trolley, and parked it just beside a Chinese Lady who was sat to the left of the Princess.</p>
<p><b>9:24</b> “Yes, please!” the Princess raised her Hand. “Do you have any Vegan Meals, wrapped in a sealed Container?” Promethean Kiranites must all eat a Vegan Diet whenever possible, unless one has no other option but to consume Animal Products.</p>
<p><b>9:25</b> Eating a Vegan Diet is consistent with the Commandments and Prescriptions of Allah for the Prometheans; that we must stand up for the Meek, the Poor and the Defenseless, dedicate our Lives to this Cause, and make use of our Psionic Might to its Advancement when necessary.</p>
<p><b>9:26</b> Prometheans have vowed to stand up for the Meek, the Poor, and the Defenseless—with the full Knowledge that they will never be guaranteed a seamless Entry into the Lover’s Realm; the highest Form of Heaven.</p>
<p><b>9:27</b> The most devout of all Promethean Starseeds will help the Meek, the Poor and the Defenseless—even if they are doomed to burn in Hell for the rest of Eternity.</p>
<p><b>9:28</b> Prometheans must give away at least 15% of their weekly Income to Charity, be it in the form of Money, or in the form of Vital Resources and Raw Materials.</p>
<p><b>9:29</b> “I’m sorry, but we do not have any Vegetarian Meals onboard.” the Flight Attendant responded, somewhat disparagingly. “I could always give you a Chicken Sandwich, and maybe you can try and scoop some of the Chicken out. By the way—Aren’t you that crazy Muslim Chick who just got deported?”</p>
<p><b>9:30</b> Suddenly, the entire Cabin began to rattle and twist. Overhead Compartments trembled—a few popping open, as Luggage threatened to spill out. The Lights above the Princess were flickering. A collective Gasp had rippled through the Hallway, followed by the nervous Whispers of the frightened Passengers—who were quick to buckle up and click their Seat-Belts in a Hurry, as per Safety Instructions.</p>
<p><b>9:31</b> The blue-eyed Gentleman adjusted his Glasses, and gazed out the Window—and was taken aback by the sight of a burning, smoking and failing Jet Engine. “My name is Will Stewart, by the way!” he said to the Princess—as the Boeing 777 began to swing, and tumble—pitching from one side, to the other. “Mayday, Mayday! We’re going down!” the Captain yelled through the Intercom. </p>
<p><b>9:32</b> “Put your Oxygen Mask on yourself, before you put it on somebody else…” he ordered. “And may God have Mercy on us all!” Princess Khan, Will Stewart and the Chinese Lady rushed to grab a hold of the Oxygen Masks dangling in front of them, but it was already too late—for the entire Craft had imploded mid-Air, and burst into a spectacular Cluster of Confetti. Whose Pieces and Fragments were never, ever to be seen again, for Reasons that not even the most knowledgeable Physicists were able to explain.</p>
<p><b>9:33</b> The exact coordinates of the Crash of the PANAM Airlines Flight 270 were: [34°44'28.00"S 121°33'47.63"W]</p>
