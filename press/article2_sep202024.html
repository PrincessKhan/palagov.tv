	<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: green; background-color: rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.25);"><i>Last modified: 11th of November, 2024 at 8:23a.m.</i></p>
        <!-- <p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: white; background-color: rgba(250, 125, 75, 1);"><i>...UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!</i></p>-->
        <p><b>Introduction: The Problem</b></p>
        <p>Like it or not &ndash; we live in the age of Nietzsche's Last Man; a passive, cowardly and toothless individual who is fundamentally incapable of rebelling against his superiors as a result of his domestication.</p>	
        <p>Psychiatry is, to that effect, the new Christianity &ndash; and Therapy; the new confession booth, particularly under Capitalism where any sort of disdain or dissatisfaction with the system <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2ScNPKwO4">will inevitably be pathologized</a>, because to them &ndash; there is no alternative to Liberal Democracy, and we have already reached 'the perfect society' (i.e. No Society).</p>
        <p>Not all hope is lost, however &ndash; for if life gives you lemons, then one ought to be making lemonade, not orange juice.</p>
        <p>We can effectively weaponize the Western, liberal obsession with psychiatry and mental illness in order to achieve our goals &ndash; and one way to do this is by not only faking mental illness, but also invoking it in order to get a free out of jail card, particularly if one is a political activist engaged in direct action.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p>I'm personally really good at passing myself off as a mentally ill woman, because I've studied just about every diagnostic manual that is out there to the T, in addition to taking Drama classes as a student back in high school.</p>
        <p>Simply having greater energy, passion and motivation than the average Human could already cause one to be classified as a potential 'manic-depressive' or 'schizophrenic' &ndash; because the last thing they want is for highly ambitious trouble makers to be inspiring others to take charge of their own lives, and rise to Power.</p>
        <p>Practically lobotomizing them, and confining them to a life of sitting in a quiet room, and staring longingly out the window &ndash; much like they did to the <i>Witches of the Dark Age</i>, or anyone deemed to be 'a victim of demonic possession'.</p>
        <p>And thus, both Christianity and Psychiatry fall under the category of: Boring, soulless, dull and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOJLGpfnX34">life-denying philosophies and ideologies.</a></p>
        <p>If someone like Nikola Tesla, Friedrich Nietzsche, Leonardo Da Vinci or even Jesus Christ and the Buddha were alive today &ndash; they would all be diagnosed as mentally ill, and removed from society &ndash; at least if they had been born in a First World country.</p>
        <p>This is the reason why heroism and greatness have ceased to exist in the world of the modern Liberal, leaving behind nothing but a vast ocean of obese, zombified consumers who worship the very narcissistic celebrities and billionaires who oppress them.</p>
        <p>Think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kdRdzxdZQ">Wall-E</a> from Walt Disney, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flLoSxd2nNY">minus the promise of Fully Automated Luxury Communism.</a> A world inhabited by the lovers of comfort, predictability and stagnation, cast aside by an upper class of obscenely wealthy Overmen.</p>
        <p>Not even slaves anymore &ndash; but <b>Bugs.</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p>Think about how awesome it is, though: We get to be witches, jokers and certified Tormented Souls‚Ñ¢ of our day &ndash; despite having no edgy tattoos, good hygiene, manners, discipline, normal bodyweight, not doing any drugs, and dressing like a normal person.</p> 
        <p>Secular substitutes for ancient traditions, just like the clinical world of psychiatry and modern science.</p> <p>Not even the TikTokkers can beat that &ndash; nevermind Jared Leto!</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
        <p><b>Are We Doomed to <br>be Ignored? Not So Fast.</b></p>
        <p>Our goal here is to simply abolish rents, bring down the cost of housing to $80,000NZD (or less), and then also pave the way for our transition towards a more egalitarian society &ndash; <b>and to do it as fast as possible, so that we may enjoy the fruits of our labour in our lifetimes, while we are still young.</b></p>
        <p>Yet depending on how fast you want to achieve your goals, you will have to use radically different strategies &ndash; and the strategy of politely asking landlords, shareholders and bankers for rent decreases and debt forgiveness, is simply not going to cut it.</p>
        <p>Nevermind the fact that you probably won't even get your UBI, and your rent pause &ndash; because they've already figured that you don't have any Power, or leverage, whatsoever.</p>
        <p>They don't respect you anymore.</p>
        <p>You are weak, they are strong &ndash; the lion eats the rabbit, and there's nothing you can do about it.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>        
        <p><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
        <p>The easiest and most effective way to fake mental illness is to be bold, ambitious, heroic, disciplined, motivated, and religiously devoted to a cause, almost as if you thought you were the Second Coming of Christ, or Napoleon. (Or the Anti-Christ, for the matter.)</p>
        <p>Make sure you dress well, have good hygiene, don't do drugs, don't overeat, exercise, eat a good diet, and don't overreact to negative stimuli or situations.</p>
