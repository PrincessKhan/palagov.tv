        <p><b>Morning Nausea</b></p>
        <p>I woke up this morning with a loud ringing in my ear, and a heavy sense of confusion about my surroundings.</p>
<p><a name="145f"></a>Prior to that — I had found myself stuck
inside of the allegorical Minotaur maze, running away from a male IDF
(Israel Defense Force) soldier who had been scouring the whole
building with a hunter’s knife, calling out my name; and out for
blood.</p>
<p><a name="9b2c"></a>It was like some kind of a swimming pool
changing room, but shaped like a maze. There were benches and locker
rooms everywhere, so plenty of spaces to hide — but also plenty
of spaces to be ambushed, and taken by surprise.</p>
<p><a name="ed42"></a>I had a backpack with me, as well as a small
pouch full of tools — so I pulled out my hack saw, and a pair
of scissors — and went on the prowl, looking to see if I could
take out the Minotaur.</p>
<p><a name="0333"></a>I stepped inside of the Men’s bathroom, and
then turned on the faucet to wash my hands, being careful not to make
too much noise.</p>
<p><a name="b32c"></a>All of the sudden — the door slammed wide
open, and the Minotaur walked right in — pointing his knife
right under my neck.</p>
<p><a name="4cab"></a>“Alright, fine!” I sighed, and yelled at
him. “Let’s have sex!”</p>
<p><a name="41d3"></a>The Minotaur took two steps backwards, lowered
his knife — and then slowly pulled his pants down, followed by
his underwear — and lo and behold, there it was: <strong>a
rather tiny, small… and disappointing Sight.</strong></p>
<p><a name="23a2"></a>“So?” he stood there looking at me, all
embarrassed and awkward.</p>
<p><a name="c2f0"></a>“I think I’ll pass, thanks.” I whispered,
and then made my way out of the toilet as fast as I could.</p>
<hr/>

<p><a name="e979"></a>It would be fair to say that I’ve already
conquered most of the demons that have haunted me in this world,
spare for the final two that have gotten the best of me,
chiefly — the demon of Loneliness — and the demon of
Boredom.</p>
<p><a name="0d48"></a>I can handle just about anything that life
throws at me. Ocean waves, spiders, heights, getting T-boned by a car
on my moped, COVID-19, earthquakes, bullying at school, bullying at
the workplace, etc.</p>
<p><a name="f62f"></a>Yet none of that has ever translated into any
sort of success in my life, and instead — I now live in a world
where it’s practically impossible to really make any meaningful
connection with anyone whatsoever. No matter how much grass you
touch… no matter how much grass you smoke… no matter how much you
self-improve, or how many languages you learn.</p>
<p><a name="8a03"></a>The fact of the matter is that, nobody
cares — and nobody really owes you anything in this world.</p>
<p><a name="25ae"></a>The only thing you can truly rely on is
Yourself, but even that will eventually just sink you further and
further into bottomless rabbit holes of despair — which in turn
renders you into an even shallower, and more embittered shadow of
your former self.</p>
<p><a name="1bdd"></a>I used to think that watching so-called
‘Manosphere’ content would make me into a better person. I
thought that I could maybe <em>steal </em>some of those ideas, and
apply them to my own life, and try to be a less ‘triggered’ sort
of individual. You know — try to be less offended, and less of
a <em>‘special snowflake’.</em> Which is one of the things that
people on the conservative Right were complaining about, non-stop.</p>
<p><a name="064d"></a>“Fine!” I yelled at the clouds, all the way
back in 2017 — when Donald Trump first became president of the
United States of America.</p>
<p><a name="e4e6"></a>“I’ll stop being a special snowflake, and
buy myself a MAGA hat. And then go around posting frogs, and doing
Nazi salutes on YouTube, and all that stuff. And then see if people
will finally be friends with me!”</p>
<p><a name="171a"></a>But it turns out — it was all just
another trick by the Wotan to try to mess with my mind, and carry on
torturing me.</p>
<p><a name="794d"></a>Because now it’s actually the <em>conservatives</em>
who are walking around being special snowflakes, and complaining
about antisemitism, and online hate. You can’t win, can you?</p>
<p><a name="e1ed"></a>“Alright then.” I said to myself this
morning. “I’ll stop being an <em>Edgelady</em>, and go back to
being myself. No more caring about what people think, and no more
following random ideas and ideologies that do not align with the very
core of my being!”</p>
<p><a name="3015"></a>But now, of course, it’s a little too
late — the damage has been done.</p>
<p><a name="73ac"></a>All those people who supposedly called
themselves ‘Warriors 4 Jesus’ were nothing more than sockpuppets
for the Wotan… and now there’s no way in <strong>Hell</strong>
that I’ll ever be able to make a connection with anyone whatsoever.</p>
<p><a name="7ac7"></a>I got played, and I got played rather cleverly.</p>
<p><a name="c0ae"></a>And I only have myself to blame.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western"><a name="bc3e"></a>Preparations</h3>
<p><a name="6c50"></a>They say that one man’s Utopia, is another
man’s Dystopia.</p>
<p><a name="3ad0"></a>“A boring and sad day for you, would be an
Earthly paradise for a family trying to survive in Gaza today”</p>
<p><a name="e079"></a>And indeed — they were right. I am an
ungrateful piece of garbage, and I don’t deserve anything good in
this world. All that self-improvement and <em>toughening up</em> has
only made me more toxic, and less desirable to others — not
more — and now it feels as if my heart is slowly beginning to
malfunction, with palpitations lasting all the way up to the
15-second mark.</p>
<p><a name="a312"></a>It’s like you just can’t win, and I don’t
know what to do anymore. I am wholly convinced that I already find
myself trapped inside Hell, and that I’m about to find out what’s
at the very bottom of it.</p>
<p><a name="8778"></a>“You should have just put down the phone, and
quit social media then!” But the things is — I already tried
that back in 2013-2017 — back when I was visiting bars and
nightclubs on a daily basis, and doing small talk with strangers in
public places to try to improve my social skills.</p>
<p><a name="8268"></a>It really didn’t make any difference, and
those were actually some of the <em>worst</em> years of my life. Not
that it really matters all that much.</p>
<p><a name="c4ef"></a>All things are Nothing to me — and I am
just about getting ready to go and burn in the deepest circle of
Hell — so that I can at least have some kind of structure, and
predictability to my existence.</p>
<p><a name="cdb2"></a>I just want <em>something</em> in my life to
make sense, you know? I want <em>something</em> to at least be
explainable using my own words, and my own interpretation of what on
Earth is happening to me, and what the Hell is going on.</p>
<p><a name="6e4e"></a>So this is what I’m going to do, every single
Wednesday night from now on.</p>
<p><a name="6fb8"></a>I am going to donate exactly 34USD to a random
charity, all around the world. For 63 weeks straight. And then I’ll
go back into my robotics lab — and carry on doing my <strong>Works</strong>,
for the rest of the week.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western"><a name="5ef0"></a>Abandon all Hope, ye who
come&nbsp;here!</h3>
<p><a name="f714"></a>I am ready to cave in, and let the Wotan take
my soul — but I won’t allow him to take anybody else’s.</p>
<p><a name="d10d"></a>I shall spend the rest of eternity being
incinerated, frozen and then incarcerated in a <em>super-positioned</em>,
<strong>Analog Inferno</strong> — where I will endure the agony
of everlasting Boredom, and Loneliness.</p>
<p><a name="e525"></a>And I’ll take my punishment <strong>Like a
Man</strong>. Not like some wimpy, overly-apologetic YouTuber with a
Ukulele.</p>
<p><a name="0cb5"></a>Apologizing is for the Weak.</p>
<p><a name="80b1"></a>A Goddess does not apologize for her
actions — and considering the damage I’ve inflicted unto
others over the years, and the ease with which I pulled it all
off — it seems that I possess far too much <strong>Power</strong>
and <em>Privilege</em> to ever allow myself to be thought of as some
kind of a <em>victim</em>.</p>
<p><a name="3bca"></a>I am not a victim.</p>
<p><a name="cd63"></a>I am the Victimizer.</p>
<p><a name="6438"></a>I regret nothing. I stand by my actions, I
stand by every single thing that’s ever come out of my mouth — and
I couldn’t have asked for a better fate.</p>
<p><a name="717c"></a>I did it because I was bored, and because I had
nothing better to do.</p>
<p><a name="6ff6"></a>I did it for the <em>Lols</em>— and to keep
the plot moving, I suppose.</p>
<p><a name="3d13"></a>I did it it all for Myself. Because I love
myself.</p>
<p><a name="97c5"></a><strong>I did it because it was genuinely
Funny.</strong></p>
<blockquote><a name="e7af"></a>Now let me go to Hell, and suffer
in&nbsp;Peace.</blockquote>
