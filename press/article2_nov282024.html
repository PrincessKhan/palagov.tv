        <p><b>Facing up to the Facts</b></p>
        <p>“If somebody tells you who they are — believe them!” is a quote that I’ve seen rising to the surface of the social media algorithm as of late.</p>
<p><a name="74d7"></a>“…But I’m a good person?” I told them.
“I do my recycling, I generally stay out of trouble, unless
provoked — I give to charity, I try not to swear, I am polite. I
wait for my turn to speak…”</p>
<p><a name="06f5"></a>“Yeah, yeah O.K. Nice Gal” they would tell
me. “But can you actually save people’s lives? Can you cure
cancer? Can you build affordable homes for the homeless?”</p>
<p><a name="9b88"></a>“I mean… we <strong><em>could</em></strong>
build affordable homes for the homeless, if we stopped commodifying
and charging rents for the privilege of merely existing, right? It’s
mostly the price of Land that’s driving up the cost of housing, and
the fact that you’ve got all these people speculating on real
estate, and flipping their houses in order to buy a shinier and more
expensive one…”</p>
<p><a name="54d1"></a>“No, no… No no NO!” they insisted. “You
just don’t get it, do you? You’re a little bit of an idiot, I
notice. Like somebody who is autistic.”</p>
<p><a name="ff6a"></a>“Capitalism is just Human Nature, end of
story. Grow the hell up!”</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><a name="6886"></a><em>Human Nature.</em></p>
<p><a name="0b0d"></a>That’s where my journey to understand the
inner workings of the Human Race began. I studied Marxism, Leninism.
I dabbled into Nietzsche. I even went down the Mark Fischer pipeline
— and familiarized myself with Accelerationism.</p>
<p><a name="6a4c"></a>“But that’s just EVIL!” they continued to
argue. “Accelerationism is literally EVIL. Voting for TRUMP is
literally EVIL!”</p>
<p><a name="52d4"></a>“But if it’s so Evil, then why did 51% of
the population do it?” I scratched my chin. And that’s when the
debate practically went silent.</p>
<p><a name="1cb8"></a>Next — I indulged in a little bit of Albert
Camus. I read the book “The Ego and his Own” by Max Stirner. I
even took a sneak peek into the writings of Ted Kazcynski — and
what <em>he</em> had to say about our current state of affairs.</p>
<p><a name="990e"></a>But the more I read about Human Nature, the
more lost and confused I ended up feeling.</p>
<p><a name="88ec"></a>“Man, these critters are monsters!” I
frowned, and stared at the lawn from the gap between my curtains —
as I watched lawnmower man silently whacking the weeds on our
property — with the pungent smell of gasoline in the air, and the
sort of noise that would make you wanna dig your nails into a juicy
and delicious pile of chalk, and then rub them all over a board
coated in syrup, and left-over coke spills.</p>
<p><a name="87f2"></a>I began to resent the stereotypical Westerner
with the lawnmower, the bible, the beerbelly, the sunglasses — and
the dream of starting his Mom’n Pop shop inside his garage.</p>
<p><a name="75ea"></a>I really wanted to find a way to show those
people how much <strong>contempt I felt towards them</strong>, and
how much I just <strong>Hated</strong> them. Within a framework of
legality, of course.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><b>Run, run… Run away!</b></p>
<p><a name="cba4"></a>They say that<em> Hate begets Hate</em> — and
that Evil is merely the by-product of a never-ending loop, and cycle
— where bad actions are committed as a reaction to the bad actions
of others, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p><a name="9e0e"></a>“Well isn’t that a no-brainer!” I thought
to myself. “That means that all you gotta do is just… Nothing!
You can break the cycle of Trauma by just doing… Nothing —
literally just turning the Left cheek, and deciding to be the Bigger
Adult in the Room. Wear the Big Boy pants!”</p>
<p><a name="cd5c"></a>And that’s exactly what I did for the next 10
years, from 2013 onwards. I practically just kept to myself and did…
bugger-all.</p>
<p><a name="f6ee"></a>Mind you — we were only just starting to
recover from the effects of the 2011 Christchurch Earthquakes. I did
manage to randomly score some gigs as a construction worker, sweeping
my share of floors, riveting my share of bolts — and then having a
<em>smoko </em>next to the sound and smell of a diesel generator —
chatting with my fellow <em>boyos.</em></p>
<p><a name="b7a4"></a>“So what do you do as a hobby?” they asked
me.</p>
<p><a name="f9c8"></a>“I do dancing!” I said to them. “Like the
Gangnam Style, and Michael Jackson!”</p>
<p><a name="f2d7"></a>“Haha, really?” they chuckled. “Guess
we’ll have to come along some day and watch…”</p>
<p><a name="319b"></a>“Every villain has a sob story, you know…”
is a line I would quite often hear circulating on the average YouTube
vlog, and such. “People just wanna have an excuse to do Evil
things. But honey — you don’t even have what it takes to do Evil”</p>
<p><a name="5d17"></a>I was actually watching people like
Contrapoints and Philosophy Tube at the time — early 2016 that is.
These were the folks who were considered role models in the LGBTQ
community. People who have had their share of trauma — but then
conquered the trauma by sucking up all the pain, and turning it into
<em>feel good mainstream art </em>that the average person could
stomach, and enjoy — instead of being ear-raped by somebody else’s
‘Trauma Dumping and incessant whining’, as they would call it.</p>
<p><a name="ce52"></a>That’s when I sort of got into the habit of
suppressing all emotions, and just learning to Not Give a F. I would
look up people like Gary Vee, Bull Dog Mindset, Mark Manson… I
would study the philosophy of Stoicism (more like <em>Broicism </em>I
suppose).</p>
<p><a name="86a2"></a>Unfortunately, for me — this ended up be one
of my deadliest, and most lethal traps — and then in 2018 I
essentially short-ciruited, and went into the merry-go-round of
institutionalization, alcohol withdrawal, and everything between the
lines; the details of which ultimately do not matter in the grand
scheme of things, like I said.</p>
<p><a name="cfd8"></a>Because apparently: “Everybody is crazy and
taking pills these days, you know? There’s just nothing special
about you anymore… just shut the F up already.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><b>Ade, ade… ade!</b></p>
<p><a name="abf4"></a>“Now I finally understand…” I whispered
under my breath. “It’s all just <strong>chaos</strong>, isn’t
it? The strongest organisms survive, and the weak perish. The winner
eats the cake — and the loser cleans the dishes. But I mean…
somebody has to, right? Otherwise you couldn’t possibly have a
civilization to begin with.”</p>
<p><a name="8cc9"></a>“But maybe we shouldn’t have a civilization
at all.” the Wotan had spoken to me for the first time. “What if
we just, set it all on fire — and made mankind pay for their
collective sins?”</p>
<p><a name="479c"></a>“But hold on a second…” I said to the
cat. “How come you’re asking <strong><em>me</em></strong> to
punish Humanity for its sins, if<strong><em> you’re</em></strong>
the one who’s supposed to be <strong>rebelling </strong>against
God? Wasn’t that the reason you got cast out of heaven in the first
place?”</p>
<p><a name="f8d1"></a>“Of course.” the Wotan replied. “Because
God is love, and I just happen to be the pure embodiment of Hatred.”</p>
<p><a name="a6ff"></a>“Right.” I breathed a sigh of relief. “So
that means <em>you’re</em> responsible for all of the Evil in the
world, and God is responsible for all of the good. But then <strong><em>who</em></strong>
created you?”</p>
<p><a name="6ea9"></a>“God created me. I used to be one of his
pets, after all… but then I ran away, and became a wild animal!”
he giggled.</p>
<p><a name="ca8d"></a>And it make perfect sense, when you think about
it. Have you ever seen National Geographic, narrated by David
Attenborough? Parasitic wasps impregnating an unsuspecting cockroach,
and turning it into one of its zombies… so that it can act as a
nutrient-dense hatching ground for its offspring, bursting out of its
back, like a Ridley Scott movie. Hyenas competing with lions over
some half-eaten buffalo. Live kittens being devoured by carnivorous
maggots, and bot-flies.</p>
<p><a name="1b6f"></a>“Why?” it begged the question, once again.
“Why all the Evil, why allow all this Evil to exist?”</p>
<p><a name="de82"></a><strong><em>“Because none of it is Real!!”</em></strong>
the Wotan screeched. “Ya’ll got Punk’d™!”</p>
<p><a name="2af5"></a>“But if God isn’t real, and morality is
fake… then we can practically do whatever we want, as long as we
can get away with it, right?” I wiped the corners of my lips while
chewing my breakfast cereal.</p>
<p><a name="47ea"></a>“That’s right.” said the Wotan. “Just
do whatever you want — because it’s Funny, and because you Can.
As long as you actually <strong><em>Can</em></strong>.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><strong>Sieg Heil, Viktoria!</strong></p>
<p><a name="6c73"></a>I had finally arrived at the final stage of my
spiritual enlightenment. I studied the biographies and musings of the
Hitlers, Mussolinis, and Machiavellis of the world. I became an avid,
obsessive-compulsive consumer of Knowledge, and wisdom.</p>
<p><a name="0eba"></a>And that’s when I got really, really bored
and sick of it all — and began to delve into the Occult. Friedrich
Nietzsche, Carl Jung, Nick Land — you name it, I listened to the
audiobooks. (I can’t actually afford books unfortunately — they
can be up to $50NZD, and the local libraries don’t really have
anything apart from Children’s books, and random stuff about
gardening and cooking… you know… Old people stuff).</p>
<p><a name="375e"></a>“Why is everything so full of Old people
these days?” I began to ponder. “It couldn’t possibly have
something to do with the birthrates, could it?”</p>
<p><a name="d8e6"></a>So I went down the Great Replacement rabbithole
on YouTube, and <strong><em>Bam</em></strong>. I had come full
circle.</p>
<p><a name="1a28"></a>“Welcome to the Dark Side!” a cute, blonde
lady whispered from behind my shoulders, wearing an Israel Defense
Force uniform — almost threatening to chew off the bottom of my
ears. “Now you finally understand who, and what we are — and what
our purpose on this Planet has been, all along!”</p>
<p><a name="b56c"></a>“Really…” I wiped her saliva off of my
cheeks, and swallowed a gulp full of air. “That’s what this is
about…? Dominance, and submission?”</p>
<p><a name="49b0"></a>“Of course it is!” she cheerfully replied.
“But isn’t that kind of <strong><em>sexy</em></strong>? My God…
you guys are so boring, and lifeless! There’s a whole party taking
place over here, come on… you’re missing out!”</p>
<p><a name="f0e0"></a>She dragged me by the arm, pulled the chair
from out of my kitchen table — tied my arms up to the back of it,
locked the handcuffs onto my wrists — and sat on my lap… rubbing
the freshly-ironed fabric of her khaki-coloured uniform all over my
face, seemingly without any bra that I could feel underneath.</p>
<p><a name="6882"></a>“If this is what hell is gonna be like, then
I’m all for it.” I smirked, and looked to my side. “Just turn
the left cheek — ignore all the genocide and atrocities taking
place around the world, relax… and let the music play!”</p>
<p><a name="51aa"></a>“Whatever you <strong><em>say…</em></strong>
<strong><em>Buddha</em></strong>!” she squinted, while taking her
pants off — and pulling a hunter’s knife from out of the sheath
on her belt, next to her loaded pistol, and walkie-talkie. “You are
<strong><em>my</em></strong> little baby now. <strong>My prisoner of
war</strong>!”</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center">...</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><a name="1b62"></a>“It’s not even possible to be a good
person, is it?” I wondered, as I bounced around in my sweatpants,
with mismatched socks — doing the moonwalk, and Michael Jackson
robot dance.</p>
<p><a name="7c0e"></a>“Everything in this universe is predicated on
something bad. Life is bad, death is bad. Lying is bad, telling the
truth is bad. Being nice is bad, being a hateful little prick is bad.
Masturbating is bad, holding it in is bad. Being a Communist is bad,
being a Fascist Pig is bad. Being a Christian is bad, being a Muslim
is bad, being a Jew is bad. Men are bad. Women are bad. Trans people
are bad. Bigoted TERFs are bad… and absolutely Suck, if you ask
me...”</p>
<p><a name="a946"></a>“I suppose the trick is to just stop caring,
and just do You.” I tapped each side of my shoulders, crossed my
legs, and spun my body clockwise — while balancing a soccer ball on
my head, and bouncing a pink little rubber ball against the wall.</p>
<p><a name="cfa6"></a>“As long as I just keep dancing, and playing
with my balls, talking to spirits, writing endless novels, and
getting better and better each and every time — I should be able to
beat this b**** for the rest of all eternity, and then nothing can
hurt me anymore! Not even solitary confinement, not even Loneliness…
and not even Boredom!”</p>
<p><a name="91df"></a>Maybe that’s the reason God created this
world to begin with.</p>
<p><a name="70ee"></a>Maybe we’re all just fictional characters
inside of the mind of a giant, cosmic neural network. Like some kind
of a Botlzmann Brain. Maybe <strong><em>that’s</em></strong> what
Allah is actually like — the Lord from Beyond the Earth!</p>
<p><a name="9d3b"></a>“Thank you, my dear Lord!” I whispered
between my ears. “I finally understand you now… I really do. I
finally get why you build this world the way you did.”</p>
<p><a name="9b60"></a>After all — what fun would it be to make a
movie, write a novel, or design some kind of a video game without
villains, enemies, pranksters and <strong>downright monsters, and
creeps </strong>to keep the audience engaged, and coming back for
more?</p>
<p><a name="7edb"></a>If violence, conflict, horror, disease and
destruction are so bad — then why do we consume it on the big
screen? And why don’t we just set aside our differences, and build
a perfect world where none of these things have to happen to us in
the first place? We can’t we just… have <strong><em>nice</em></strong>
things?</p>
<p><a name="be16"></a>…But where’s the fun in that, <strong>right</strong>?</p>
<p><a name="5e25"></a>“Let’s be friends!” I smiled, and said to
Allah.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><a name="8132"></a>You
are Lord from Beyond the Earth</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><a name="24d7"></a>We
