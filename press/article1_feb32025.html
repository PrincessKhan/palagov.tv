        <p><b>1:1</b> “When I die—I wish to be reincarnated in Gaza—so that I can go and fight the Zionist Bastards on my own Terms!” Princess Khan whispered to herself, upon stepping out of the Shower, and wringing her hair out with the Towel. She stood in front of the Mirror, and squeezed at the bulging Layer of abdominal Fat around her Waist, as her Stomach turned in Disgust; a physical Manifestation and Reminder of all the Years of gluttonous, decadent and ungrateful Dining.</p>      
        <p><b>1:2</b> “I shall resist the gravitational Pull of Mediocrity, and Sloth!” she exclaimed. “For it is a deadly Sin for me to be stuffing my Face with Food—while Fathers, Mothers and their Children go hungry amidst the Ruins of Occupied Palestine—on the other Side of the World!”</p>
        <p><b>1:3</b> And so began the 47 days of intermittent Fasting—during which the Princess would consume no more than 63 Grams of Chocolate, 4 Chicken Eggs, and 3 Scoops of Blueberries worth of Calories for Breakfast—along with a Cup of Juice, a Glass of light Wine or a Pint-full of light Ale before Bed.</p>
        <p><b>1:4</b> Princess Khan resided in New Zealand; a far-away Land known for its majestic Landscapes, crystal-blue Oceans and Rivers, and friendly, Peace-loving Folk. Where the White Man lived in Harmony with the native Inhabitants; the Pakeha, and the Māori, respectively. Or so it seemed upon first Glance.</p>
        <p><b>1:5</b> “Once upon a Time, we were Warriors” said the Princess during one of her daily, real-time, live-streamed Video Presentations. “But now… Look at us now! What has become of us? Nothing but sedated, submissive, docile and domesticated Blobs of Meat… I say!”</p>
        <p><b>1:6</b> Yet none of the People watching her Videos were in any particular Mood to listen to what the Princess had to say—for they were all busy munching away at their Bags of Corn Chips, binge-watching endless Variations of the same archetypal ‘Murder Mystery’ Series on Television, and concerning themselves with the Reviews of the newest Open World, Role-Playing, Online Games.</p>
        <p><b>1:7</b> “The World has already moved on from Folks like yourself!” the Viewers disparagingly had commented. “We no longer wage Battle over political Disagreements! We talk it out like civilized, Human Beings.” they said, as the Riot Police prepared their Batons and Bullet-proof Shields on the Streets of Minneapolis, Terran Empire. </p>
        <p><b>1:8</b> “We no longer wage Battle over Land, and scarce natural Resources! We work for it, and then we Pay for it!” they said, as the Working Poor and Homeless Folk injected themselves with their daily Dose of Fentanyl, and sought shelter inside of their Cars and Tents on the cold hard Streets of Philadelphia, Terran Empire.</p>
        <p><b>1:9</b> “We no longer go on Grand Adventures, and religious Pilgrimages! We go to the Cinema to drool over the latest Movie. Or go to the Comic Convention to bear witness to the latest Video Game Release—where we can all live out our Dreams and Fantasies as Cowboys, Rogues and Knights in shining Armor! We no longer concern ourselves with dreadful, disturbing existential Questions—we stop asking Questions, and stay excited for the next Product!“ they said—as the young Men and Women dressed up as colorful, wide-eyed Animals, and engaged in Orgies, Lewdness, and the most violent, exhibitionist and grotesque Displays of sexual Behavior.</p>
        <p><b>1:10</b> “Well,” the Princess paused, and clenched her Teeth ever so slightly. “If that’s what you consider to be the Peak of Modernity, Peace and Progress—then I am more than happy to proclaim myself a violent, mentally deranged, and psychopathic Weirdo! An Insurrectionist; a Revolutionary! An Authoritarian; a Terrorist! A Barbarian; a Savage! Someone who ought to be medicated into Oblivion, and locked away in a mental Asylum—to be forgotten by the Liberal Democratic, New World Order—for the rest of all Eternity!”</p>
        <p><b>1:11</b> She switched off her mobile Device, pulled her Duvet over herself, and her Tortoise-Shell Cat—and then drifted off into a deep Slumber—her Stomach rumbling and growling; hungrier than ever before, as the Clocks struck past 12 at Midnight, February the 4th.</p>
        <p><b>1:12</b> What kind of God could possibly have the Nerve, and the Audacity to create a World like our own—with so much Suffering, Misery and Inequality? Where the Privileged, and the Wealthy get to be tormented with bouts of clinical Depression, and creeping Nihilistic Boredom—while the rest get to starve, and be bulldozed to Death by military Jets, and armored Vehicles in the Desert, on the other side of the World? Or be drowned in the Mediterranean Sea as they search for a better Life in the Liberal World—only to be met with Prejudice, and Contempt at the Border?</p>
        <p><b>1:13</b> “We truly live in a Hell Realm!” The Princess spoke to Allah, as she departed from the Coast of Whakatāne on her make-shift Raft, and Outrigger Canoe, with a Polytarp Sail strapped in-between the Hulls—headed straight towards Raoul Island, Kermadec—in search of a more glorious, adventurous and heroic way of Life. “I am done with the World of Man! I hate the Human Race! I want nothing to do with the Terrans anymore!”</p>
        <p><b>1:14</b> Yet the Swells in the South Pacific Ocean had proved to be treacherous—with some of the Waves towering at up to six Meters above her flimsy little Boat—a Testament to the Enormity, and the lethal and destructive Power of Mother Nature. Humbling the proud, loud and disgruntled Princess Khan at the blink of an Eye.</p>        
        <p><b>1:15</b> “You run your Mouth too much, yet barely do you ever do!” said the Lord from Beyond the Earth, peeking from behind the growing Cluster of dark, grey Clouds. As He began to unleash a Torrent of Thunder, Wind and Rain.</p>
        <p><b>1:16</b> “The Lord rewards those who take Action, and he who practiꞇe what he preaches, above all else. For it is only through the Marriage and Intersection between the Realm of Dreams, Ideas, and Possibilities—and the Realm of Limitations, and the Material—that Progress comes about, and the Objects of our Imagination can have a chance at Materializing, and being willed into Existence!”</p>
        <p><b>1:17</b> “But Lord—I do not understand!” the Princess yelled, as she fought and wrestled for her dear Life amidst the relentless Pitching of the Waves, and the neverending Gusts and Winds full of Sand and Sea-Water—blowing, scratching, and spraying all over her Face. “I just want to live a happy Life! Why do I have to endure so many Years of Betrayal and Rejection, just to have the Opportunity to experience a single Moment of Love?”</p>
        <p><b>1:18</b> “Why do I have to tolerate so much Hatred, Bullying and Discrimination, just to have a stable Career, and a Place of my own for me to call Home? Where do I even belong—if neither the Russians consider me to be a Russian—and nor the Venezuelans, consider me to be a Venezuelan?“</p>
        <p><b>1:19</b> “You belong with Me, and my Kingdom.” Allah said to the Princess. “For your Spiritual Battle begins today. No Man will ever be able to reliably predict, and foresee what the Lord Almighty has arranged for him in Paradise! Yet the Clues and Signs are all around you.”</p>
        <p><b>1:20</b> “But Father—all I see is Madness, Decadence and Despair!” Princess Khan continued to protest. “If this is the Work of an Almighty, All-Loving and Benevolent Being—then surely enough—you must be some kind of a sado-masochistic Tyrant, ruling over a Terranium full of Beetles, Ants, and Cockroaches!“</p>
        <p><b>1:21</b> Yet the Lord would only laugh, and respond with ever more Thunder, Wind and Rain. He was neither bothered, nor offended by the Criticisms that the Princess had laid upon his Masterpiece. Hours had passed—and the Storm began to clear. “We all get the Worlds and Realms that we deserve, in the End.” said Allah. </p>
        <p><b>1:22</b> A brave and courageous Warrior, shall be transferred to the Warrior’s Realm; where they can wage Battle against their sworn Enemies, till the End of Time.</p>
        <p><b>1:23</b> A greedy, gluttonous, Capitalist Pig—shall be transferred to the Merchant’s Realm; where they can trade and gamble amongst themselves, stuff themselves full of Cake, and be drowned in their own Gold and Material Possessions.</p>
        <p><b>1:24</b> A nymphomaniac Decadent, shall be transferred to the Hedonist’s Realm—where they can have endless Orgies, Parties and Hits of their favourite recreational Narcotics.</p>
        <p><b>1:25</b> A passionate Lover, and dedicated Philanthropist—shall be transferred to the Lover’s Realm—where they can live out an idyllic Life with their stunningly beautiful and gorgeous Soul-Mates.</p>
        <p><b>1:26</b> Serial killers, Murderers, Rapists and genocidal Maniacs shall be transferred to the Punisher’s Realm—where they can forever face the Scorn and Torment of other Demons sharing their Likeness, and Mirror Reflections.</p>
        <p><b>1:27</b> Those who despise Civilization, shall be transferred to the Jungle Realm—where they can live naked, shameless and free of all Burdens and Responsibilities, with no one to boss them around, or tell them what to do.</p>
        <p><b>1:28</b> And those who have had enough of Existence… those who no longer wish to exist—shall be devoured by the Void, the Source, and the Stardust we all originally came from!” …and so the Princess woke up, and rubbed the Corners of her Eyes.</p>
