        <p>
          <b>Part 1: Introduction</b>
        </p>
        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>My name is Khan, and this is the orientation video for our organization &ndash; which we created for the sole purpose of uplifting the cognitive capabilities of Humans living in poverty, so as to enable them to rise above the slavery and decadence of our modern, hyper-Capitalist world.</p>
        <p>We have set out to create a breakaway society of augmented super-men who will have the capacity to not only wage a Revolution against the upper class, but also become Gods who could then go on to build their own civilization from scratch if they wish.</p>
        <p>For the Astromaryan Path is one of individual empowerment, and it is only through the intellectual enrichment and physical improvement of our members that we can avoid becoming dependent on [anyone] whatsoever, whether it's the C.E.O. of a corporation, a political leader, a family member, or otherwise.</p>
	<p>Human civilization is becoming increasingly more fragmented. Federations will split into nations. Nations will split into tribes. Tribes may even become families and lone-wanderers living in the woods. No more society &ndash; only an ecosystem of lost souls with no place to call home.</p>
	<p>Enlightenment values, liberalism, social media, and the free flow of information have enabled individuals to think critically, and essentially <i>break</i> the old forms of conditioning and social engineering that used to hold society together, namely: Religion, and Government.</p> 
	<p>This is a good thing for the most part. Freedom and liberty are noble values worth upholding, yet without the support of large-scale civilizations &ndash; individuals will become weaker, and poorer. Unless we smarten up, figure out the ins- and outs- of Human Nature, arm ourselves with knowledge and become the strongest tribe of all.</p>
	<p>From there you will be in a far better position to create a more egalitarian society where its members can cooperate and achieve great things as a team; for individuals alone will never be as Powerful as a unified tribe working towards a common goal, or fighting a common enemy.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Part 2: Let's Get Practical</b>
        </p>
        <p>Alright, enough about theory! Let's get practical, and talk about our roadmap, as well as the obstacles we will encounter on our way to completing our mission.</p>
        <p>For those of you who aren't familiar with who I am, and my accomplishments: I am a self-taught engineer who has created a robotic clone of myself.</p>
        <p>I am neither a licensed therapist, nor a neuroscientist: but I do have significant experience when it comes to my own journey of self-improvement and spiritual enlightenment.</p>
        <p>Though there may be a lot to be gained from listening to the experts, and going to therapy &ndash; I don't actually think that experts and therapists have all the answers.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Because otherwise, we wouldn't be having an epidemic of mental health problems, drug overdoses and suicides.</b>
        </p>
        <p>I would even go as far as to say that Psychiatry, in its current form, is a mediocre pseudoscience that is doing far more harm than good. It's basically just Bread and Circuses disguised as medicine &ndash; because keeping people fat, sedated, submissive and addicted to drugs and electronic entertainment, is the only way the wealthy can get away with milking the cattle for their wages, and physical labour.</p>
        <p>Therapy under Capitalism is practically mind control, and as I've already explained: Anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and anxyolitic medications are the lobotomy of our age, a lobotomy in a pill that is geared toward the enrichment of pharmaceutical companies; whose business model is no different from that of a drug kingpin peddling their glorified street heroin to the weak.</p>
        <p>Just remember: We're not telling you to quit therapy, and quit your medication. All we're offering is a different perspective, and I feel that it's about time that we did.</p>
        <p>I believe the cult of Psychiatry and Mental Health has done so much harm, that kids and young people are now walking around gaslighting themselves into believing that they have a mental health disorder, in addition to gaslighting and diagnosing other people who probably didn't even ask to be diagnosed in the first place.</p>
        <p>Believe it or not: You probably don't have ADHD. Nor do you suffer from Depression, or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I think the problem is more to do with the fact that we live in a highly toxic and unnatural environment that is incompatible with most people's temperaments and cognitive limitations.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately &ndash; both the Left and the Right-wing camps of political thought are equally guilty of gaslighting other people into thinking that they're insane, when they're probably just in a bad financial situation, or disconnected from their cultural roots, and communities.</p>
        <p>That's not to say that you should abandon the scientific method, detatch from reality, and embrace being delusional, living in a fantasy world that you've made up inside your own head &ndash; though I will actually cover that matter in our video in just a few seconds.</p>
        <p>I just think it's frustrating that we have people celebrating obesity, drug addiction, passivity and submissiveness, and then going around selling therapy as if they were better than you and me &ndash; especially the Leftists who were supposed to fight all of that garbage.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that our organization is an inclusive space that does not discriminate against people of other races and ethnicities. Nor do we discriminate against trans, gay, lesbian, bisexual or queer individuals. In fact, our movement is heavily [in favour] of trans rights, and we will soon be releasing some videos on this topic which will include tutorials such as <i>How to brew your own injectable medication</i>, and such. </p>
        <p>
          <b>Part 3: The Art of Uplifting</b>
        </p>
        <p>Uplifting is just as much of an Art, as it is a science, though we believe that science has its blindspots much like faith, and religion &ndash; and that in order to become fully actualized beings, we need a healthy balance between science, faith, spirituality and philosophy.</p>
        <p>By far the easiest way to increase your own intelligence is to increase [motivation], and you would have no doubt already heard about the movie <i>Limitless</i> in which the protagonist stumbles upon a miracle drug that is capable of giving him the focus, energy and attention he needs to get his life in order, and achieve all of his goals. </p>
        <p>In addition to the scientific studies that show that a person's I.Q. actually [increases] if you promise to give people a reward of, say, $200 if they complete their I.Q. test.</p>
        <p>And it makes perfect sense &ndash; because I can't count how many times I've heard people say "I'm really smart, but I'm also lazy" &ndash; when really, it just means that you have to boost your executive functioning and motivation by all and any means necessary, instead of making excuses.</p>
        <p>I personally don't believe in I.Q. tests, because I.Q. has already been debunked as a mediocre pseudoscience, just as the field of modern psychiatry, and Mental Health eventually will be. The fact that Large Language Models and Image Recognition tools can pass I.Q. tests, already tell us that our understanding of intelligence was flawed from the beginning.</p>
        <p>The only way to prove your intelligence is to set a goal, and then achieve it. If you can achieve it, then you are smart, and if you don't achieve it &ndash; you are delusional. It's that simple.</p>
        <p>Because that's what that intelligence ultimately is: The ability to create accurate simulations and abstractions of the material reality you inhabit, in order to better navigate it, and increase your chances of achieving your goals.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Part 4: The Art of Game Theory</b>
        </p>
        <p>Game Theory is likewise both an Art, and a science, and that's how I personally like to define it: The Art, Science and Mathematics of predicting the behaviors of autonomous, sentient creatures (i.e. Agents, Players) &ndash; as well as the Art and Science of explaining [why the world is the way that it is]. (The Game).</p>
        <p>The meaning of life is disappointingly simple: Life is a Game in which individual organisms compete over Power and maximum control over their environment. The strong survive, the weak perish &ndash; and there's nothing you can do about it.</p>
        <p>We can certainly try to [minimize] the suffering that is inherent to Life, by creating complex and sophisticated systems of ethics, and morality &ndash; in addition to law, and order. (Because otherwise, we would all just be savages tearing each other to shreds in the jungle).</p>
        <p>But the fact that there exists so much poverty, hatred, slavery and inequality in our world, indicates that our current systems of law and morality have failed us, and that we must do everything in our Power to come up with a better alternative.</p>
        <p>The problem is that Human Nature is inherently selfish, and self-centered. Which in turn tends to produce narcissistists, tyrants and authoritarians who go around enslaving and manipulating other people to their benefit. Turning them into zombies and lobotomzied minions, and then telling them to seek therapy when they refuse to obey.</p>
        <p>But this doesn't have to necessarily get in the way of achieving our goals &ndash; <b>because it's perfectly legitimate to want to create a more egalitarian society for selfish reasons.</b>
        </p>
        <p>This is why Game Theory is going to be so important: because Game Theory will give you the tools to understand and explain <b>why the world is the way that it currently is, and why people behave the way that they do.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In Conclusion</b>
        </p>
        <p>So as you can see, our organization was created for the purpose of saving the Left, in addition to saving the world from the chaos and destruction that awaits us in the years to come.</p>
        <p>Yet even if only a small number of us were living a life of misery, and poverty &ndash; we still believe this is morally unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Because nobody should have to live in poverty &ndash; and if only a [single] person is unhappy with their place in their society, then the whole society deserves to be folded in on itself, and burned to the ground.</p>
        <p>We are not Utilitarians. We don't believe that the happiness of a majority legitimizes the suffering of the few. This is also why I believe that Liberal Democracy is a failed system.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the Island, and welcome to the MANA Initiative: where we teach, explore and discuss various topics and disciplines as it pertains to science, art, music, engineering, philosophy and the supernatural &ndash; including, but not limited to: fitness, noogenesis, cognitive computing, robotics, decentralized manufacturing, agriculture, plant breeding, psionic abilities and utopian social engineering.</p>
